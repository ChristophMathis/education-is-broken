## MOOC-related references

Both MOOC references match their published sources, but one numeric detail in your prose is approximate.

- **Jordan 2015** – Your .bib entry “Massive Open Online Course Completion Rates Revisited: Assessment, Length and Attrition” in International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning 16(3), 341–358 is correct.[[erudit](https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/irrodl/2015-v16-n3-irrodl04980/1065985ar.pdf)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/f17659d4-af9a-4d91-890b-2918f549a4c3/03.agency.bib)]​
    
    - The article reports completion rates **0.7%–52.1% with a median 12.6%**, and also an average completion of about **6.5%** in one summary of the dataset.[academia+1](https://www.academia.edu/13467027/Massive_open_online_course_completion_rates_revisited_Assessment_length_and_attrition)
        
    - Your text states “completion rates hovered around 5–10 per cent,” which is a fair, rounded description of the range but not the exact statistic; if you want tighter fidelity, you could change this to “typically in the low single digits to low teens, with a median around 12%” or similar.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)]​[[erudit](https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/irrodl/2015-v16-n3-irrodl04980/1065985ar.pdf)]​
        
    - The `note = {VERIFY}` flag in the .bib is appropriate until you decide whether to use the precise figures or a rounded narrative formulation.[[erudit](https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/irrodl/2015-v16-n3-irrodl04980/1065985ar.pdf)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/f17659d4-af9a-4d91-890b-2918f549a4c3/03.agency.bib)]​
        
- **Reich & Ruipérez-Valiente 2019** – “The MOOC Pivot” in Science 363(6423), 130–131; your .bib entry matches the canonical citation.[[tsl.mit](https://tsl.mit.edu/research/the-mooc-pivot/)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/f17659d4-af9a-4d91-890b-2918f549a4c3/03.agency.bib)]​
    
    - The way you use it in the chapter (to support the idea that MOOC benefits skew toward already-educated learners) is consistent with the article’s findings on who persists and earns credentials.[[tsl.mit](https://tsl.mit.edu/research/the-mooc-pivot/)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)]​
        

## WGU 2023 report

- Your .bib entry lists **Western Governors University**, title **“Annual Report 2022”**, institution and address, plus URL pointing to WGU’s annual-report page.[wgu+1](https://www.wgu.edu/about/annual-report.html)[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/f17659d4-af9a-4d91-890b-2918f549a4c3/03.agency.bib)]​
    
- The chapter uses WGU to support claims that:
    
    - WGU has served “over 350,000 students” through competency-based models.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)]​
        
    - WGU has pioneered and scaled competency-based education.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)]​
        
- Current WGU reporting shows a similar **order of magnitude** in total alumni and degrees awarded (hundreds of thousands), though exact numbers vary by year (e.g., 352,368 total degrees awarded as of end of 2023, 390,244 alumni as of mid‑2025).[wgu+1](https://www.wgu.edu/about/annual-report.html)
    
- Given that:
    
    - “Over 350,000” is directionally consistent but time-sensitive.
        
    - Your BibTeX includes `note = {VERIFY: confirm exact report title and enrollment figure}`, which correctly flags that you should align the prose number with whatever specific year’s report you ultimately cite.[wgu+1](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/introducing-2023-annual-report2404.html)[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/f17659d4-af9a-4d91-890b-2918f549a4c3/03.agency.bib)]​
        
- Recommendation: once you pick a fixed reference year (e.g., 2022 or 2023 report), update the chapter to use that report’s precise figure (e.g., “WGU has awarded over 350,000 degrees as of 2023”) and then remove the VERIFY notes.[[wgu](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/introducing-2023-annual-report2404.html)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/f17659d4-af9a-4d91-890b-2918f549a4c3/03.agency.bib)]​
    

## Alignment between .md claims and sources

- Claims about **self-regulated learning cycles** and agency as planning–monitoring–reflection are well-supported by Zimmerman (2002) and Pintrich (2000).[03.agency.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)
    
- The statement that **autonomy supports learning when paired with competence and relatedness** aligns with Deci & Ryan’s self-determination theory.[03.agency.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)
    
- The four **conditions for agency** (structured challenge with feedback, explicit metacognitive instruction, mentorship/accountability, emotional stability) are consistent with the combined evidence of Blair & Raver (self-regulation and stress), Flavell and Schraw & Dennison (metacognition), and CDC YRBS mental health trends.[[wgu](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/introducing-2023-annual-report2404.html)]​[03.agency.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)
    
- The link between **socioeconomic status and academic achievement** is directly supported by Sirin (2005).[03.agency.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)
    
- The argument about **early tracking in Germany** reproducing socioeconomic differences is supported by Hanushek & Woessmann (2006) on tracking and inequality.[03.agency.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/5aaccd6b-ef84-4ed1-96c9-3f1e2410fa7c/03.agency.md)
    

I do not see any claims in the chapter that conflict with what these sources report; the only places that merit tightening are (a) the approximate MOOC completion statistic if you want exactness and (b) the WGU enrollment/degree count, which should be locked to a specific report year.
