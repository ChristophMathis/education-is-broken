The in-text literature references in `08.the-stratification-trap.md` and the entries in `08.the-stratification-trap.bib` are largely consistent and well aligned, with only a few items flagged by your own notes as needing verification or minor clean‑up.[08.the-stratification-trap.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/854acb39-104c-4685-88b5-75c7ba644af3/08.the-stratification-trap.md)

## Overall validation

- All explicitly cited works in the chapter body (e.g. Reich and Ruipérez‑Valiente 2019; OECD 2025a/b/c; Rensimer and Brooks 2024; Frontiers in Education 2023; Clausius Press 2025; PMC 2021/2024a; Scrivener et al. 2015; Roder and Elliott 2019; Posse Foundation 2024; AVID 2024; Deloitte 2025; Contrary Research 2024; Rogers 2024; PR Newswire 2017; Müller 2017; Bates 2014; AICerts 2025; SeatsOne 2025; Full Fabric 2024; Congruence Market Insights 2024; Schiller 2024; Taylor & Francis 2024b; Merton 1968; Huang 2024) have corresponding BibTeX keys and entries.[08.the-stratification-trap.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fe47278a-441d-4192-a93b-7d5ab3b4f9d2/08.the-stratification-trap.bib)
    
- The “Annotated Source List” items 1–32 at the end of the markdown are all backed by BibTeX entries, with numbering and descriptions matching the bib content.[08.the-stratification-trap.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/854acb39-104c-4685-88b5-75c7ba644af3/08.the-stratification-trap.md)
    
- The Matthew‑effect origin (Merton 1968) is now correctly included in the .bib and matches how you invoke it in sections 5 and 7.[08.the-stratification-trap.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fe47278a-441d-4192-a93b-7d5ab3b4f9d2/08.the-stratification-trap.bib)
    

## Items that still need attention

1. **BibTeX file completeness / syntax**
    
    - The `.bib` snippet you attached is truncated mid‑file; make sure the final version has:
        
        - A closing `}` for every entry.
            
        - No stray comments inside entries.
            
    - In the AICerts entry, the domain in the bib (`aicerts.ai`) differs from the URL mentioned in the annotated list in the .md (`aicerts.io`); choose one canonical URL and align both files.[08.the-stratification-trap.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/854acb39-104c-4685-88b5-75c7ba644af3/08.the-stratification-trap.md)
        
2. **Entries you’ve marked as VERIFY**
    
    - `RoderElliott2019` — you note in the `note` field that both the **title and URL need confirmation** and that there are multiple Year Up reports; this flag is correct and should be resolved before publication.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fe47278a-441d-4192-a93b-7d5ab3b4f9d2/08.the-stratification-trap.bib)]​
        
    - `PosseFoundation2024` — you mark the **exact URL path as VERIFY**; the graduation‑rate claim and organisation are fine, but you should confirm the final URL you want to cite.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fe47278a-441d-4192-a93b-7d5ab3b4f9d2/08.the-stratification-trap.bib)]​
        
    - `AVID2024` — similarly marked VERIFY for the exact path; confirm and either update the URL or remove the VERIFY comment.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fe47278a-441d-4192-a93b-7d5ab3b4f9d2/08.the-stratification-trap.bib)]​
        
3. **Minor consistency points between .md and .bib**
    
    - In the annotated list, the AICerts report is described as hosted at `aicerts.io/ai-and-human-skills-societal-impact-2025/`, while the bib entry points to `aicerts.ai/news/ai-and-human-skills-societal-impact-2025/`; pick one canonical citation and mirror it in both locations.[08.the-stratification-trap.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/854acb39-104c-4685-88b5-75c7ba644af3/08.the-stratification-trap.md)
        
    - The description of Roder & Elliott (2019) in the annotated list (“earnings gain of 30% sustained over multiple years”) matches the _intent_ of the bib entry, but because you explicitly warn that title/URL may be slightly off, that source still counts as provisional.[08.the-stratification-trap.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/854acb39-104c-4685-88b5-75c7ba644af3/08.the-stratification-trap.md)
        

## Recommendations for final clean‑up

- Run the `.bib` through a BibTeX linter or your LaTeX toolchain to catch any missing braces or commas once you paste in the full content.
    
- Resolve all `VERIFY` notes (Roder & Elliott, Posse, AVID, and the AICerts URL discrepancy) and then remove those internal comments from the `note` fields to avoid shipping self‑referential editorial flags.
    
- After resolving URLs, do a quick search in the `.md` for each source name (AICerts, Year Up, Posse, AVID) to ensure the narrative description still matches the updated reference (e.g., if the Year Up report title changes slightly).
    

If you like, you can paste the _full_ `.bib` text here and I can point out any remaining syntax errors line‑by‑line.
