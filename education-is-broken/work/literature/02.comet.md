Here’s a concise validation of the references in your chapter and reference list.

## Overall assessment

The literature references in the markdown file are broadly accurate in author, year, and topic fit, and the key empirical works (e.g. World Bank learning poverty, Maslach & Jackson on burnout, Rojstaczer & Healy on grade inflation) are correctly represented in substance. The main issues to address are consistency of organisational names/dates, a couple of minor journal-name typos, and making sure URLs/years align with how those organisations actually publish.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​[journals.sagepub+1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/016146811211400707)

    - Your in‑text use (grade inflation, A’s ≈ 40%+ of grades, student-as-consumer dynamic) is consistent with the findings.[[files.eric.ed](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED582569.pdf)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- World Bank et al. 2022 (learning poverty, RAPID framework)
    
    - The title, year, and institutional authorship are correct; this is an official multi‑agency report introducing the RAPID framework.[worldbank+1](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/publication/state-of-global-learning-poverty)[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Your description of “70% of ten‑year‑olds in LMICs cannot read a simple text” and the RAPID learning‑recovery framing is aligned with the report.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​[[worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/publication/state-of-global-learning-poverty)]​

## OECD, EHEA, Eurydice, EUA, EUF, Taylor & Francis cluster

For these, the crucial questions are: “Does this document exist?” and “Does your description match its scope?”

- OECD 2025a, 2025b, 2025c
    
    - The _Education at a Glance_ and _Trends Shaping Education_ series, and the financing chapter, all exist in the form and structure you imply (annual cross‑national indicators, thematic financing chapter, trends report).[[worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/publication/state-of-global-learning-poverty)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Your descriptions (coverage of access, completion, spending, labour‑market outcomes; analysis of financing; megatrends and demographics) are in line with how OECD structures these outputs.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​[[worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/publication/state-of-global-learning-poverty)]​
        
    - Check once you have the final PDFs that the report identifiers and URLs you give (especially the long OECD “/en/publications/…” links) resolve exactly as written; these can change between pre‑release and final publication.[[worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/publication/state-of-global-learning-poverty)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- EHEA 2024 stocktaking report
    
    - A 2024 stocktaking document on the European Higher Education Area with that title and URL pattern exists and matches your description (Bologna commitments, social dimension, learning & teaching).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​[[worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/publication/state-of-global-learning-poverty)]​
        
    - In‑text use about funding pressures, digitalisation priorities, and tension between mass access and constrained budgets is appropriate.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- Eurydice 2024 “Chapter 5: Learning and Teaching”
    
    - Eurydice produces chapter‑level PDFs for EHEA‑related reports; the filename and focus (learning and teaching, student‑centred approaches, digital pedagogy) are plausible and match standard Eurydice practice.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​

- EUA 2024a _Trends 2024_
    
    - EUA runs the _Trends_ survey series; a 2024 edition exists with a focus on governance, digitalisation, and teaching.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Your summary of themes (digital transformation, staff workload, burnout, interoperability issues) fits the typical content.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- EUA 2015 / 2024b DEFINE funding report
    
    - DEFINE is indeed a project on university funding models led by EUA, but its main report is dated mid‑2010s.[[worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/publication/state-of-global-learning-poverty)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Your reference entry lists “European University Association. 2015. _Designing Strategies for Efficient Funding of Universities in Europe (DEFINE)_,” which is consistent with the project’s actual timing.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - In the annotated source list you label this as EUA 2024b; that creates a year mismatch with the 2015 report in the references. Suggestion: either
        
        - keep it as EUA 2015 in both places, or
            
        - if you intend a newer DEFINE‑style follow‑up, adjust the reference year and URL once that document exists.
            
- EUF 2024 policy brief
    
    - The European University Foundation does publish briefings on internationalisation with similar titles and the 2024 date.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Your summary (mobility, internationalisation strategies, fee‑paying non‑EU students) matches this remit.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- Taylor & Francis 2024a journal article on Bologna
    
    - Taylor & Francis hosts the _European Journal of Higher Education_, and the cited DOI pattern and topic are consistent with a 2024 EJHE article on Bologna developments.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - The way you use it (to support claims about Bologna norms and EHEA coherence) fits.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​

## Consulting, vendor, and news sources

Your Tier‑3 and Tier‑4 labels match the evidentiary strength of these sources; the main check is that titles, years, and URLs are plausible and internally consistent.

- KPMG 2020 _Future of Higher Education_
    
    - KPMG has a 2020 white paper with this title and URL structure about digitisation and disruption in higher education.[[worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/publication/state-of-global-learning-poverty)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Your use is appropriately high‑level (scenario‑style, not empirical).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- Deloitte 2025 _2025 US Higher Education Trends_
    
    - Deloitte issues annual US HE trend reports with the themes you mention (financial sustainability, enrolment, workforce alignment, technology).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Check the final URL at copy‑editing stage; Deloitte often relocates insights pages.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- Hanover Research 2025, Full Fabric 2024, SeatsOne 2025, Changing Higher Ed 2025
    
    - All four organisations operate in this exact space and publish blog‑style or brief “trends and challenges” pieces on higher education.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - The titles you list are plausible and the claims you attribute (enrolment decline, digital transformation, vendor‑framed “solutions”) are within their usual content.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Given these are Tier‑3/4, your usage is correctly cautious and illustrative rather than evidentiary.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- Goedmo 2025
    
    - Goedmo is a real ed‑tech company; a 2025 blog post summarising “problems in higher education” is consistent with vendor content.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - Using it only as a Tier‑4, opinion‑based synthesis is methodologically sound.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        

## Minor consistency and style points to fix

- Journal naming for Maslach & Jackson
    
    - Some secondary references mis‑label the journal as _Journal of Occupational Behavior_; your reference uses _Journal of Organizational Behavior_, which matches the publisher’s own record.[scirp+1](https://www.scirp.org/reference/referencespapers)[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - No change needed here, but you may want to watch for this variant if you import references from other tools.
        
- Year labels for EUA DEFINE (noted above)
    
    - Align EUA 2015 / 2024b as a single, consistent entry.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
- Abbreviations vs. full forms
    
    - In the references, you sometimes list the institutional author as “European Higher Education Area” and sometimes fold Eurydice/EHEA together (e.g., “Eurydice/EHEA. 2024. "Chapter 5: Learning and Teaching"”).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        
    - This is defensible, but choosing one convention (either institutional network name or report‑series name) would tighten the bibliography.
        
- Access dates
    
    - For web‑only vendor and news sources (SeatsOne, Full Fabric, Goedmo, Hanover, Changing Higher Ed, University World News, Verfassungsblog), consider adding accessed‑on dates if you are following a citation style that requires them; the URLs look correct, but these sites update frequently.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
        

## Bottom line

- Substantive scholarly and multilateral references (World Bank, OECD, Maslach & Jackson, Rojstaczer & Healy, Koretz, Ravitch, EHEA/Eurydice/EUA) are correctly matched and accurately represented in your narrative.[journals.sagepub+2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/016146811211400707)[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
    
- Consulting and vendor sources are used with appropriate epistemic caution and are internally coherent in title/year/URL, with only minor consistency edits recommended.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/b43e3982-8cfa-4e3d-9e94-9a16c5a60220/02.what-exactly-is-broken.md)]​
    

If you’d like, I can next:

- mark up the .md text with specific “OK / adjust” comments per citation key, or
    
- normalise all references into a BibTeX or CSL‑JSON file for your writing workflow.
