# Revision Roadmap

A concise revision blueprint could focus on clarifying the core thesis,
tightening causality, and integrating equity and labour-market dynamics
more
systematically.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **1. Clarify the core thesis and scope**

- Add a short “What exactly is broken?” section in the introduction
  that:

  - Distinguishes between K–12, higher education, and corporate
    learning.

  - Defines “broken” along 3–4 dimensions (e.g., learning outcomes,
    equity, cost, labour-market fit).

- Insert a 1-page “System map overview” that previews how the three
  parts (universities, enterprise learning, recruiting) interact and
  what the book claims *should* change in
  each.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Concrete edits:**

- Rename or qualify the main claim early: “Why large parts of higher
  education are structurally misaligned in an AI era” rather than
  “education is broken” as a blanket statement, unless K–12 is
  substantially expanded
  later.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **2. Make the “intelligence factory vs university” argument rigorous**

- In Part 1, after the Intelligence Factory metaphor, add a subsection
  “Replacement, complement, or layer?” where you:

  - Specify which university functions AI can realistically replace
    (content delivery, some assessment), which it complements (tutoring,
    analytics), and which remain human/institutional (research,
    socialization, character formation, public
    mission).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

  - Explicitly state that the realistic future is a *hybrid* (unless you
    want to argue for near-full replacement, which would require much
    stronger evidence).

- Add a short table contrasting: Traditional university / Intelligence
  factory / AI-era hybrid institution across 5–6 dimensions (content,
  assessment, socialization, signalling, research,
  governance).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **3. Build explicit change models (who changes what, when)**

- Before the “Innovative Approaches” section, insert a chapterlet: “How
  systems actually change” that:

  - Identifies main actors (governments, accreditation bodies,
    institutional leaders, faculty, employers, EdTech firms, students).

  - Maps incentives and constraints (funding formulas, political risk,
    union power, employer demand, platform economics).

- For each major design principle (CBE, micro-credentials, AI-first
  models, alliances), add a “Adoption reality check” box that briefly
  covers:

  - Current scale and where it’s concentrated.

  - The 2–3 main blockers (regulation, funding, capacity, culture).

- In the conclusion of Part 1, include a 5–10 year scenario matrix
  (e.g., axes: “regulatory openness” vs “institutional capacity”)
  instead of a single linear
  future.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **4. Resolve degree vs portfolio tensions**

- In the “From degrees to signals” section, add a subsection “Degrees
  are not dead—yet” that:

  - Acknowledges empirical evidence that many high-status jobs still
    filter on
    degrees.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

  - Distinguishes between sectors where portfolios already dominate
    (e.g., some tech, design) vs those where degrees remain hard gates
    (regulated professions).

- At the end of the micro-credentials and recruiting chapters, add a
  synthetic section:

  - “The future signalling stack,” outlining a layered regime: baseline
    degree (for some roles) + micro-credentials + project portfolio +
    AI-verified
    evidence.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

  - Specify time horizons (what is likely in 5 years vs 20 years) and
    what would need to change for degrees truly to recede (e.g.,
    regulatory reform, insurance and liability models, professional
    bodies).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **5. Integrate equity and stratification as core design constraints**

- After the “Agency divide” and “Pitfalls and traps” sections, create a
  dedicated chapter “The stratification trap” that:

  - Synthesizes: Matthew effects in alliances, corporate capture,
    selection bias in peer-learning, digital divides, mental-health and
    preparedness
    gaps.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

  - Frames them as central design constraints, not side risks.

- For each archetype (AI-first, peer-only, global campus-free,
  Guild-type corporate models), add a short box:

  - “Who benefits most?” (by SES, prior achievement, geography).

  - “Who is structurally excluded or disadvantaged?”

  - “What corrective design features are non-negotiable?” (e.g., funded
    coaching, devices/connectivity, agency-building curricula, public
    oversight).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **6. Tighten evidence hierarchies and temper generalizations**

- Insert a short methodological note early in Part 1 or as an appendix:

  - Differentiate vendor case studies, institutional pilots,
    meta-analyses, and large-scale evaluations.

  - Explain that the book uses them at different “strength levels.”

- Where you cite strong quantitative claims (e.g., “X% improvement,”
  “categorically superior”), add:

  - A one-sentence caveat on context and sample, and

  - If available, a counterexample or note that large-scale, independent
    replication is
    pending.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- In the CBE and micro-credentials sections, explicitly reconcile:

  - The meta-review finding “hardly any evidence of effectiveness” with
    success cases like WGU/SNHU, by specifying the conditions under
    which CBE seems to work (e.g., adult, motivated learners, strong
    support) and where evidence is
    weak.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **7. Make the public mission and humanistic agenda explicit**

- Add a chapter near the end of Part 1: “AI-era universities as public
  institutions” that:

  - Articulates a positive model: research, democratic citizenship,
    cultural memory, and local/regional development as *design anchors*.

  - Discusses funding models compatible with modular credentials and
    corporate partnerships without full
    marketization.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- In that chapter, revisit the “crucible of character” idea and make it
  concrete:

  - Describe what institutional practices and environments this implies
    (residential experiences, project-based community work, deliberative
    forums, etc.), not just as
    metaphors.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **8. Separate descriptive, normative, and speculative content**

- At the beginning of each major part, add a short legend or framing:

  - “This chapter describes current trends (D).”

  - “This chapter argues for normative principles (N).”

  - “This chapter explores speculative scenarios (S).”

- In sections on AI-first universities, intelligence factories, and
  autonomous agents:

  - Insert brief signposting sentences like “This is a speculative
    scenario given current technical trajectories and may not
    materialize without major regulatory and cultural
    shifts.”\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **9. Improve integration between Parts 1, 2, and 3**

- Add a short “Bridging chapter” at the start of Part 2 (“Education in
  the Enterprise”) that:

  - Explicitly states: which failures of universities corporate learning
    is compensating for, which it cannot or should not replace, and how
    corporate learning depends on foundational education
    quality.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- At the end of the recruiting section, add a systemic “Feedback loops”
  chapter:

  - Show how employer practices (skills-based hiring, AI screening,
    credential preferences) feed back into:

    - University program design and alliances.

    - Government policy (funding, quality assurance, regulation).

    - Corporate learning strategies.

- A single system diagram (even just described in text) could show flows
  of people, credentials, data, and funding between universities,
  companies, platforms, and
  regulators.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​
