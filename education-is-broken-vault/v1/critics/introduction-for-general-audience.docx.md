# Introduction for General Audience

Here’s back-cover style copy plus a short, non-technical introduction
aligned with a general educated
audience.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **Back-cover style copy**

Everyone agrees that “education is broken,” but few can explain *how*—or
what to do instead. This book follows students, workers, and employers
through universities, companies, and hiring systems to show why the old
model is cracking and what might replace
it.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

Universities were built for a world where knowledge was scarce, degrees
were rare, and careers followed a predictable ladder. Today, AI tutors
can teach on demand, skills change faster than curricula, and employers
rely on algorithms and portfolios as much as diplomas. The result is a
quiet unbundling: content, credentials, and careers are drifting away
from traditional institutions into platforms, workplaces, and global
networks.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

Drawing on real-world experiments—from competency-based online
universities and global campus-free models to European university
alliances, employer-sponsored learning, and AI-driven recruiting—this
book makes sense of the chaos without jargon. It explains why some of
these innovations genuinely expand opportunity, while others risk
deepening inequality, corporate capture, or simple confusion in a maze
of
micro-credentials.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

Rather than treating technology as destiny, *Education is Broken* lays
out the choices ahead. Will we slide into a world where elite learners
enjoy rich, human education while everyone else is managed by
algorithms? Or can we build systems in which AI amplifies human
judgment, universities remain crucibles of character and research, and
lifelong learning is a right rather than a
perk?\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

For parents and students, teachers and executives, policy-makers and
lifelong learners, this book offers a clear map of the emerging
landscape—and practical ways to navigate
it.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **Short, non-technical introduction (1–2 pages equivalent)**

## **1. Why this book exists**

If you are picking up this book, you have probably felt it already:
something about education no longer fits the world we live in. A degree
costs more than a car, new skills go out of date in a few years, and
many students and workers feel anxious, burnt out, or simply
lost.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

At the same time, extraordinary new possibilities have appeared. A
teenager in a small town can learn advanced math from an AI tutor at
midnight. A nurse can take an online micro-course and qualify for new
responsibilities at work. A 40-year-old programmer can retrain for a new
role using employer-funded learning, guided by recommendation systems
that feel closer to Netflix than to
school.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

So is education broken—or is it being rebuilt? The honest answer is:
both. The old structures are under strain, but the new ones are uneven,
confusing, and sometimes
unfair.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

This book is my attempt to make sense of that transition in plain
language.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **2. What this book is (and is not)**

This is not a book about how to “hack” your grades, find the perfect
university, or pick the one right career. It is also not a technical
guide to artificial intelligence, nor a nostalgic defence of the
past.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

Instead, it is a field guide to a landscape that is changing under our
feet. We will look at three places where education now
happens:\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Universities and colleges.

- The workplace and corporate learning.

- Hiring and recruiting, where credentials are tested against real
  jobs.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

In each place, we will ask three simple questions:

1.  What used to work here, and why?

2.  What is breaking, and for whom?

3.  What is being tried instead—and what could possibly go
    wrong?\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

You do not need any background in education research or technology to
follow the argument. Whenever we talk about a new model or tool, we will
anchor it in real examples and everyday decisions: whether to enroll in
a degree, take a short course, trust an AI tutor, or believe a new
credential.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **3. How the book is structured**

The book is in three parts, but you can also dip in and out.

- **Part I** looks at higher education. We meet the “intelligence
  factory”—a metaphor for AI systems that can teach and test at
  scale—and compare it to the traditional university that combines
  lectures, campus life, and degrees. We explore new models:
  competency-based online universities, global campus-free institutions,
  peer-driven coding schools, European university alliances, and
  micro-credentials. We also take a hard look at the pitfalls:
  credential inflation, algorithmic bias, stratification between elite
  and non-elite institutions, and the risk that exciting experiments
  mainly benefit already-privileged
  learners.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- **Part II** moves into companies. Here we see how employers are
  turning learning into a continuous process: AI systems recommend
  training, track skill development, and suggest internal moves.
  Programs like employer-sponsored tuition platforms promise to give
  millions of workers a “second chance” to gain qualifications without
  debt. Again, there are trade-offs: when your employer finances your
  learning, who decides what you study and how your data is
  used?\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- **Part III** examines recruiting. We look at AI tools that scan CVs,
  analyze portfolios, run simulations, and even try to read emotions in
  interviews. We explore skills-based hiring, where what you can do
  starts to matter more than where you studied. We also see how uneven
  and messy this shift is, and why degrees still matter a great deal in
  many
  sectors.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

Across all three parts, one theme keeps returning: **signals**. A
degree, a micro-credential, a portfolio, a project, a performance
review, a simulation score—all are ways to signal ability in a noisy
world. AI does not remove the need for signals; it multiplies them. That
can be liberating, but it can also be
overwhelming.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **4. Who this book is for**

I wrote this book for people who feel caught between the old and new
worlds of
learning.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- If you are a student or parent, you will find context for decisions
  about degrees, alternative programs, and how much to trust AI
  tools.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- If you teach or work in a university, you will see how your daily
  struggles with funding, curriculum, and technology fit into a bigger
  picture.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- If you are a manager or HR professional, you will find a roadmap for
  linking internal learning, external programs, and hiring practices
  without losing sight of
  people.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- If you are simply a curious citizen, you will see why the way we
  organize learning is one of the most important political and economic
  questions of this
  decade.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

I assume you are busy. Each chapter is written to stand on its own, with
summaries and concrete examples. You can read the book straight through,
or skip to the topics that matter most to
you.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **5. What you might take away**

By the end of the book, I hope you will be able to:

- See clearly which parts of education are truly broken, and which are
  still valuable but under
  pressure.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Recognize the main new models and their strengths and weaknesses,
  without getting lost in
  buzzwords.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Understand how universities, companies, and hiring systems are linked,
  so changes in one place do not surprise you in
  another.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Ask better questions of any new program, platform, or policy you
  encounter: Who benefits? Who is excluded? What is being measured—and
  what is
  not?\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

Most of all, I hope you come away with a sense that the future of
education is not fixed by technology alone. It will be shaped by
choices—by institutions, employers, governments, and by people like you
deciding how and where to
learn.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

This book is an invitation to take those choices
seriously.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​
