# Minimum Viable Team — **Business Book Edition**
*(Thought leadership, management, consulting, strategy, professional nonfiction)*

Business books live or die on **credibility, clarity, and applicability**.  
Your minimum viable team must therefore optimize for:

- argument strength (not storytelling fluff),
- executive readability,
- and professional signaling (“this person knows what they’re doing”).

---

## Core Principle for Business Books

> **You are selling judgment, not prose.**  
> The team exists to sharpen, stress-test, and professionalize that judgment.

---

## 1. You — **Author, Publisher, Domain Authority**
**Non-delegable**

**Primary responsibilities**
- Core thesis and point of view  
- Frameworks, models, distinctions  
- Target audience definition (e.g. executives, managers, consultants)  
- Final decisions on scope, tone, and claims  
- Publishing & distribution choices

**Extra responsibility (business books only)**
- Guarding *intellectual coherence* across chapters  
- Ensuring the book supports downstream use (talks, workshops, consulting)

---

## 2. Developmental Editor — **Argument & Reader Fit**
**Absolutely mandatory for business books**

This is *not* a “writing coach”.  
This is a **thinking partner with publishing discipline**.

**Responsibilities**
- Stress-test the core argument (“Is this actually new?”)
- Remove consultant fluff and conceptual redundancy
- Enforce a clear through-line across chapters
- Ensure chapter-level promises are kept
- Align depth with reader seniority (exec ≠ practitioner ≠ academic)

**Minimum viable engagement**
- Full-outline review  
- 1–2 passes on the full manuscript **or**
- Deep review of 20–30% of chapters + pattern-based guidance

**Critical selection criterion**
- Must have **business / management publishing experience**
- Journalism-only editors are usually a bad fit

---

## 3. Copy Editor (with Line Editing Skills) — **Executive Readability**
**Mandatory**

Business readers punish:
- verbosity  
- fuzzy language  
- inconsistent terminology  

**Responsibilities**
- Grammar, punctuation, consistency
- Terminology discipline (key concepts used *exactly*)
- Sentence tightening (especially long abstractions)
- Passive voice reduction
- Light logic flagging (“this sentence contradicts earlier claims”)

**Minimum viable setup**
- One editor doing **copy + light line editing**
- Familiarity with business nonfiction tone

**Explicitly *not* their job**
- Rewriting arguments
- Changing your point of view

---

## 4. Book Designer — **Professional Signaling**
**Mandatory, higher stakes than in fiction**

For business books, design = **credibility infrastructure**.

**Interior design responsibilities**
- Clean hierarchy (headings, subheadings, callouts)
- Tables, frameworks, diagrams rendered clearly
- High scannability (executives skim)
- Print + EPUB compatibility

**Cover design responsibilities**
- Clear genre signaling (“serious business book”)
- Subtitle legibility at thumbnail size
- Visual restraint (no gimmicks)

**Minimum viable setup**
- One designer for interior
- Either:
  - same person for cover, or  
  - a specialized cover designer with business portfolio

---

## 5. Proofreader — **Risk Control**
**Mandatory**

**Responsibilities**
- Typos, spacing, formatting issues
- Cross-check headings, page numbers, references
- Final pass on print-ready PDF and EPUB

**Minimum viable rule**
- Must be a *different person* from the copy editor
- One clean pass is enough

---

## Optional but High-Leverage for Business Books

### Indexer — **Credibility Multiplier**
Strongly recommended if:
- the book is framework-heavy
- readers will *use* it as reference
- you target consultants, academics, or senior leaders

Signals seriousness instantly.

---

### Legal / Sensitivity Reviewer (Situational)
Useful if you:
- criticize named companies or leaders
- make strong claims about systems or institutions
- include case material from real organizations

Often a **short, targeted review**, not a full legal audit.

---

## Minimum Viable Team — Business Book Summary

| Role | Mandatory | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Author / Publisher | ✅ | Authority & coherence |
| Developmental Editor | ✅ | Argument integrity |
| Copy / Line Editor | ✅ | Executive readability |
| Book Designer | ✅ | Credibility signaling |
| Proofreader | ✅ | Error containment |

## What Business Authors Commonly Get Wrong

- Skipping developmental editing (“I know my field”)  
- Using fiction-oriented editors  
- Over-designing covers  
- Treating copy editing as optional  
- Publishing framework books without an index  

---

## One Final Business-Specific Rule

> **A business book is not finished when it is written.  
It is finished when a skeptical executive finds it clear, credible, and usable.**

---

If you want next steps, I can:
- map this team to **budget tiers** (lean / standard / premium)
- define a **repeatable business-book production pipeline**
- or align the book team with a **consulting or platform strategy**

Just tell me where to zoom in.
