Most of the quantitative and factual claims in the chapter line up with the cited sources, but several flagged “VERIFY” items in your .bib need tightening against the underlying reports, and a few statistics are either more specific or more tentative than the way they are currently phrased in the markdown.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/230ece74-fbe3-4b26-afb6-297f7aff2191/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.bib)]​[shrm-res.cloudinary+2](https://shrm-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1703671728/AI/AI_in_the_Workplace_Playbook.pdf)

## PwC 2024 CEO survey

- Your BibTeX correctly identifies the report as “PwC’s 27th Annual Global CEO Survey: Thriving in an Age of Continuous Reinvention” and links to the right URL.[[pwc](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2024/download/27th-ceo-survey.pdf)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/230ece74-fbe3-4b26-afb6-297f7aff2191/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.bib)]​
    
- The .bib note explicitly says the “24% figure for CEOs citing talent availability as a primary business threat should be verified.”[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/230ece74-fbe3-4b26-afb6-297f7aff2191/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.bib)]​
    
- The published survey highlights CEO concerns about long‑term viability, pressure to reinvent, and generative AI; skills/talent constraints are discussed but the exact 24% threat figure is not a headline statistic in the overview material.[pulse.icdm+1](https://pulse.icdm.com.my/article/pwcs-27th-annual-global-ceo-survey-thriving-in-an-age-of-continuous-reinvention/)
    
- Actionable edit: keep the reference but either (a) check and align your 24% sentence exactly with the table/figure in the PDF, or (b) rephrase to a qualitative statement about “a substantial minority of CEOs citing talent availability as a major concern” without a specific percentage if you do not want to re‑extract the precise number.[[pwc](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2024/download/27th-ceo-survey.pdf)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/230ece74-fbe3-4b26-afb6-297f7aff2191/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.bib)]​
    

## SHRM 2024 AI and gamified assessments

- Your BibTeX entry for `SHRM2024` is generic and marked “VERIFY,” and the chapter uses specific adoption figures (41% using AI‑powered skills assessments, 83% using gamified assessments).[07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/10c50967-0852-4c9d-b200-d29368d53021/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.md)
    
- SHRM’s materials on AI in HR and the “AI in the Workplace” playbook confirm that around 41% of organizations use AI for recruiting and hiring; this matches your 41% figure in substance.[shrm-res.cloudinary+1](https://shrm-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1703671728/AI/AI_in_the_Workplace_Playbook.pdf)
    
- However, the 83% figure for “gamified assessments” is not a standard headline metric in SHRM’s public PDFs; other sources often give different, lower percentages for game‑based tools.[shrm-res.cloudinary+1](https://shrm-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/AI/2024-Talent-Trends-Survey_Artificial-Intelligence-Findings.pdf)
    
- Actionable edit:
    
    - Either (a) attribute the 83% figure to a vendor or separate survey that actually reports it, or (b) soften to “a large majority of companies now use some form of gamified assessment” without a number unless you can locate a precise SHRM table with 83%.[shrm-res.cloudinary+1](https://shrm-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1703671728/AI/AI_in_the_Workplace_Playbook.pdf)[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/230ece74-fbe3-4b26-afb6-297f7aff2191/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.bib)]​
        

## ECIU 2023 blockchain micro‑credentials

- Your BibTeX entry for `ECIU2023` describes ECIU as “the first European University Alliance to issue jointly recognised, blockchain‑secured digital micro‑credentials using the Europass digital wallet,” with a “VERIFY” flag.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/230ece74-fbe3-4b26-afb6-297f7aff2191/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.bib)]​
    
- ECIU/KTU communications confirm that ECIU University is indeed the first European alliance to issue centrally e‑sealed micro‑credentials via the European Digital Credentials platform, with storage via Europass.[eciu-en.ktu+2](https://eciu-en.ktu.edu/news/a-milestone-reached-eciu-university-is-the-first-european-alliance-to-issue-e-sealed-micro-credentials/)
    
- The wording in your markdown about “blockchain‑secured digital micro‑credentials using the Europass wallet” is directionally correct, but the official text emphasises “electronically sealed micro‑credentials issued using the EDC platform and storable on Europass,” rather than explicitly “blockchain” in all press language.[uab+1](https://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/eciu-university-first-alliance-in-europe-to-issue-electronically-sealed-micro-credentials-1345830290613.html?detid=1345900599576)
    
- Actionable edit: you can safely keep the “first alliance” claim and Europass linkage; if you want to be maximally precise, say “electronically sealed micro‑credentials issued via the European Digital Credentials platform and storable in the Europass wallet” instead of “blockchain‑secured,” unless you add a technical EDC/ECIU source that uses “blockchain” explicitly.[[eciu-en.ktu](https://eciu-en.ktu.edu/news/a-milestone-reached-eciu-university-is-the-first-european-alliance-to-issue-e-sealed-micro-credentials/)]​[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/230ece74-fbe3-4b26-afb6-297f7aff2191/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.bib)]​
    

## Overall consistency of literature references

- Foundational theoretical sources (Spence 1973, Caplan 2018, Searle 1995, Green 1990) are cited in a way that matches their widely accepted core arguments; the claims in the text about signalling, institutional facts, and the Prussian model are faithful to those works.[07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/10c50967-0852-4c9d-b200-d29368d53021/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.md)
    
- Quantitative labour‑market and credential statistics (OECD 2024, Credential Engine 2023, Lumina 2023, LinkedIn 2024, TestGorilla 2024, Burning Glass/Harvard 2024) are used in a manner consistent with the high‑level findings described in your annotated bib notes.[[trainingorchestra](https://trainingorchestra.com/empolyee-training-trends/)]​[07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/10c50967-0852-4c9d-b200-d29368d53021/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.md)
    
- The speculative “Layer 4” content is correctly framed as conjecture rather than as direct findings of any one cited source, which keeps it honest relative to the literature.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/10c50967-0852-4c9d-b200-d29368d53021/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.md)]​
