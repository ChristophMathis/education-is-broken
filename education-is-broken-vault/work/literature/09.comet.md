All of the in-text literature references in your markdown file are present and correctly represented in the accompanying BibTeX file, but the identifiers are inconsistent between text and `.bib` in a few places.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​

## 1. References that match cleanly

These in-text citations have a clear, one-to-one match in `09.learning-in-companies.bib` with consistent author, year, and title (only BibTeX keys differ, which is fine):

Substantively these are **valid**: every cited work in the chapter appears with a corresponding full entry in the `.bib` file.[09.learning-in-companies.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)

## 2. Style inconsistencies (text vs. BibTeX)

If you want Chicago Author–Date style to be fully consistent, there are a few minor naming mismatches between how you cite in the text and how the entries are keyed or labelled in BibTeX.[09.learning-in-companies.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)

- Shapiro 2023
    
    - In-text: `(Shapiro 2023)`.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​
        
    - BibTeX: `@misc{PennsylvaniaGov2023,... author = {Josh Shapiro} ...}`.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/d68df4c4-b086-43bd-b6de-5b35c348080c/09.learning-in-companies.bib)]​
        
    - This is fine; the key `PennsylvaniaGov2023` is internal only. If you want complete clarity, you could rename the key to `Shapiro2023`, but it is not required.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/d68df4c4-b086-43bd-b6de-5b35c348080c/09.learning-in-companies.bib)]​
        
- Fuller, Langer, and Sigelman 2024
    
    - In-text: “…; Fuller, Langer, and Sigelman 2024”.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​
        
    - BibTeX: `@report{BurningGlass2024,... author = {Joseph B. Fuller and Christina Langer and Matt Sigelman} ...}`.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/d68df4c4-b086-43bd-b6de-5b35c348080c/09.learning-in-companies.bib)]​
        
    - Again, this is stylistically correct; if desired, you might change the key to `FullerLangerSigelman2024` for easier mapping.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/d68df4c4-b086-43bd-b6de-5b35c348080c/09.learning-in-companies.bib)]​
        
- European Parliament and Council 2024
    
    - In-text: “European Parliament and Council 2024”.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​
        
    - BibTeX author: `{European Parliament} and {Council of the European Union}`.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/d68df4c4-b086-43bd-b6de-5b35c348080c/09.learning-in-companies.bib)]​
        
    - This is acceptable in Chicago; your short form is slightly abbreviated but not misleading.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/d68df4c4-b086-43bd-b6de-5b35c348080c/09.learning-in-companies.bib)]​
        

## 3. Multi-source parentheses

In two places you put multiple sources in a single set of parentheses.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​

- `(WEF 2025; IDC 2024)`.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​
    
- The long parenthesis around Microsoft and SHRM:  
    `Microsoft 2024; single-company case study). Companies using predictive ... (industry surveys and vendor reports ... SHRM 2022)`.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​
    

These are conceptually correct, but the first one has no problem; the second is syntactically messy in the markdown (your parenthesis swallows narrative text and then includes `SHRM 2022` at the end).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​

I’d suggest:

- Split into two clean citations, e.g.  
    `Microsoft reduced turnover by up to 25% ... (Microsoft 2024). Every departure costs an average of $15,000 ... (SHRM 2022).`[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​
    

## 4. Items to consider tightening

These are not “incorrect,” but worth checking for alignment with the `.bib` and your own notes in the BibTeX `note` fields.[09.learning-in-companies.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)

- IDC 2024 URL and access conditions: your `.bib` already flags “VERIFY: exact publication date and URL; IDC frequently gates reports behind registration.” In the markdown you treat it as a standard public report, which is fine, but you may want a short qualifier like “proprietary modeling by IDC”.[09.learning-in-companies.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)
    
- Burning Glass/Fuller et al. 2024 title: your markdown calls it “the Burning Glass Institute … study”, while the `.bib` title is _Skills-Based Hiring: The Long Road from Announcements to Practice_. That is consistent, but if you want absolute precision, mention the full title once in the annotated sources (which you already do).[09.learning-in-companies.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)
    

## 5. Practical edits (minimal)

If your goal is “everything cross-walks cleanly and reads as polished Chicago Author–Date,” you only really need:

1. Clean up the long Microsoft–SHRM parenthesis into two separate citations as suggested above.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)]​
    
2. Optionally rename a few BibTeX keys for human readability (e.g., `PennsylvaniaGov2023` → `Shapiro2023`, `BurningGlass2024` → `FullerLangerSigelman2024`), though this is purely internal.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/d68df4c4-b086-43bd-b6de-5b35c348080c/09.learning-in-companies.bib)]​
    

Functionally, the references are already **validated**: each in-text citation has a matching, accurate bibliographic entry in `09.learning-in-companies.bib`, and there are no missing or mismatched works that would cause confusion for a reader or for LaTeX/BibTeX compilation.[09.learning-in-companies.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/fad47141-1633-4f38-a51b-b13658f659bc/09.learning-in-companies.md)
