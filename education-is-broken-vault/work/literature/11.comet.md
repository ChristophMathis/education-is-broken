Your chapter’s literature references are internally consistent between the `.md` file and the `.bib` file, but several entries require external verification or minor clean‑up before final submission.[11.universities-as-public-institutions.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/e9056e92-91cb-44fc-a98d-4aa2fa15f9ca/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md)

## 1. Matches between in‑text citations and reference list

All works cited in the body of the chapter appear in the “References” section at the end of the `.md` file, and each of those references has a corresponding BibTeX entry:

I did not find any “orphan” references (i.e., items in the References section with no in‑text citation) in the snippets provided, nor any in‑text citations that are missing from the References section.[11.universities-as-public-institutions.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/e9056e92-91cb-44fc-a98d-4aa2fa15f9ca/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md)

## 2. Items explicitly flagged as needing verification

Several BibTeX entries include “VERIFY” notes or similar, indicating that you (correctly) left placeholders. These should be checked and updated:

- `reportLevin2012`: “VERIFY exact URL.” The URL looks like a working guess and should be confirmed or replaced with a stable link or DOI if available.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `reportSommo2018`: URL should be confirmed; the base domain is right, but path segments may have changed.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `reportHESA2024`: “VERIFY exact title and data year.” Confirm the official title and ensure it matches the 2022/23 finance release, then synchronize the year and title in both `.md` and `.bib`.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `reportHouseOfCommons2024`: “VERIFY exact briefing number.” Confirm the CBP‑number and update the URL and citation if needed.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `reportOfS2024`: “VERIFY exact publication date and URL slug.” Confirm the OfS report title, date, and slug.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `reportDestatis2023`: “VERIFY exact publication number and URL.” Confirm the Destatis product ID and update the URL to the canonical version.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `reportDFG2024`: “VERIFY exact URL.” The current URL is a top‑level page; you may want the specific Förderatlas 2024 PDF or detail page.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `reportOECD2025a`: Check that the URL and year match the final published “Education at a Glance 2025” once released; at the moment this looks like a projected entry.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `articleHillman2015`: “VERIFY exact volume/pages.” Confirm 37(4)37(4)37(4) and pp. 501–519.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `articleLewandowsky2020`: “VERIFY exact year 2020 vs 2019.” The handbook has appeared with both dates in different contexts; decide on one and apply consistently.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- `articleMerkley2020`: “VERIFY exact pages.” Confirm page range in Public Opinion Quarterly.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    

These checks are all external to your files; structurally, the entries match your usage in the chapter.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​

## 3. Formatting and style consistency

Within your own corpus, the references are stylistically coherent:

- All items appear to follow a Chicago author‑date logic in the `.md` and are expressed as full‑form references in the end list.[11.universities-as-public-institutions.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/e9056e92-91cb-44fc-a98d-4aa2fa15f9ca/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md)
    
- Names, years, and publishers are consistent between `.md` and `.bib` for the items visible in the snippets.[11.universities-as-public-institutions.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/e9056e92-91cb-44fc-a98d-4aa2fa15f9ca/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md)
    
- Multi‑author references use “and” between final authors in both spaces (e.g., Scrivener et al., Hillman et al.), which is consistent.[11.universities-as-public-institutions.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/e9056e92-91cb-44fc-a98d-4aa2fa15f9ca/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md)
    

Minor issues you may want to clean up for polish:

- Some German titles/umlauts are unescaped or simplified (`Forderatlas`, `offentlich`) in the `.bib`. If you export to LaTeX, consider adding proper TeX accents (`Förderatlas`, `öffentlich`).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    
- Institutional names are sometimes repeated in `author` and `institution` fields (e.g., `Higher Education Statistics Agency HESA` vs `institution HESA`). Decide on a consistent pattern.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    

## 4. Summary of validation status

- Structural validation (matching between in‑text citations, end‑of‑chapter references, and BibTeX entries): **pass**; everything appears present and correctly paired.[11.universities-as-public-institutions.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/e9056e92-91cb-44fc-a98d-4aa2fa15f9ca/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md)
    
- Internal consistency (names, years, titles between `.md` and `.bib`): **pass** in the material visible.[11.universities-as-public-institutions.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/e9056e92-91cb-44fc-a98d-4aa2fa15f9ca/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md)
    
- External accuracy (URLs, exact titles, page ranges, years): several items still carry “VERIFY …” notes and should be checked against the original sources before publication.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/37daeda5-d46c-4062-bf4f-cb36ac045c89/11.universities-as-public-institutions.bib)]​
    

If you like, I can next:

- produce a concrete to‑do list of source‑by‑source checks (with suggested authoritative sites), or
    
- normalize the reference formatting to a specific Chicago author‑date output style you intend to use.
