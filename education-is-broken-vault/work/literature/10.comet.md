Here’s a focused validation of how the references in the .md chapter line up with the BibTeX file and where you may want to adjust.

## 1. Coverage: does every cited source exist?

All sources mentioned in the main text and “Annotated Source List” have corresponding BibTeX entries, with one minor naming mismatch and some “VERIFY” flags that you’ve already noted.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)

Minor mismatch:

- In the .md “References” list you have:
    
    - “Eurostat. 2024a. ‘ICT Specialists in Employment.’ …”
        
    - “Eurostat. 2024b. ‘Use of Artificial Intelligence by Enterprises.’ …”[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)]​
        
- In the .bib, ICT specialists is keyed `Eurostat2024`, and “Use of Artificial Intelligence by Enterprises” is keyed `Eurostat2024AI`.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)]​
    
- This is fine in an author–date style, but your letter suffixes (2024a/2024b) will be assigned by the citation processor, not by the `.bib` keys; just ensure your CSL/bibliography style is configured to disambiguate same-year Eurostat items.
    

## 2. Claims that your own bib file already flags as “VERIFY”

You’ve already annotated several entries with “VERIFY.” They correspond exactly to the more tentative claims in the chapter.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)

I would keep the verify flags and perhaps soften wording slightly in the prose (e.g., “around,” “approximately,” “survey suggests”) for:

- ResumeBuilder2024: 98% vs 99% wording.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
    
- EuropeanCommission2024SME: exact percentages for skills shortages, financing constraints, retention.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)
    
- Eurobarometer2024AI: 25% and 74% figures; Eurobarometer wave numbering sometimes shifts.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
    
- Eurostat2024AI: 8% → 13.5% AI adoption leap and exact years.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)
    
- TalentLMS2019: the 83% gamification figure; definition of “gamified” is broad.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
    
- LinkedIn2024Skills: the detailed multipliers by country and generation; URL and report title may differ slightly from final published variant.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)
    
- Glassdoor2024: the 44-day average; you already note it may be a composite with LinkedIn data.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
    
- HaysEurope2024: 77% planning competency-based recruiting; you already indicate source uncertainty.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)
    

From a literature-validation standpoint, these are appropriately caveated in both the bib notes and the narrative (you clearly signal survey/self-report limitations and forecast status), so they are methodologically defensible as long as you keep those qualifiers.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)

## 3. Consistency of titles, organizations, and years

Spot checks show consistent metadata between narrative, reference list, and BibTeX:[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)

- Organization names: Deloitte, TestGorilla, LinkedIn, Bitkom, Eurostat, European Commission, World Economic Forum, Hays, Glassdoor, UPS, Walmart, Resume Builder, TalentLMS match across files.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
    
- Years: all years in the text (e.g., Deloitte 2025, TestGorilla 2024, LinkedIn 2024, Bitkom 2023, Eurostat 2024, WEF 2025, GDPR 2016, EU AI Act 2024) match their BibTeX entries.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)
    
- Titles: where you abbreviate in the prose (“The Future of Jobs Report 2025,” “Digital Decade 2030: Targets and Indicators,” “Skills-Based Hiring: The Long Road from Pronouncements to Practice”), they align with the full titles in the `.bib`.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
    

## 4. Internal cross-references within the chapter

The way you reference evidence tiers and connect them to specific sources is internally consistent:[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)

- Tier labels in the annotated list (Tier 1–4) match the notes in the BibTeX entries.
    
- Each numeric claim that you highlight in the annotated list (e.g., 72% vs 59%, 81% vs 73%, 15.9x/10.4x etc., 3.5 percentage points, 137,000 vacancies, 20 million ICT target, 44 days, 83% gamification, 35% time-to-fill reduction) is explicitly tied to the same source in the `.bib`.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
    

If you want a tighter audit trail, you could:

- Add BibTeX key hints into the annotated list, e.g., “Deloitte (2025; `Deloitte2025HCT`)” to make one-to-one checking trivial in the source files.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)
    

## 5. Recommended concrete edits

If you’d like to “lock it down” for production:

- Harmonize Eurostat naming:
    
    - Keep `.bib` keys as-is, but in your notes mention “Eurostat 2024a (ICT specialists; `Eurostat2024`)” and “Eurostat 2024b (AI by enterprises; `Eurostat2024AI`).”[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
        
- Slightly soften the explicitly flagged numbers in the prose:
    
    - For the 99% vs 98% Resume Builder figure, consider “around 98–99% of hiring managers…” or “nearly all hiring managers…”.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)
        
    - For TalentLMS’s 83% and the 77% Hays statistic, you already flag these as survey intentions vs realized practice; the methodology note is sufficient, but you could add “in one survey” to make that clear.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
        
- Ensure your citation style will handle “European Commission 2023, 2024, 2025” and “Eurostat 2024a/b” disambiguation correctly; this is a CSL/style issue, not a content problem, but worth testing once you compile.[10.ai-in-hiring.bib+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/0855f665-9134-4156-bdc3-e7e864ceb7e7/10.ai-in-hiring.bib)
    

Overall, your references are well-structured, internally coherent, and fully backed by the BibTeX file, with the only caveats being the “VERIFY” items you’ve already clearly marked and a minor Eurostat naming nuance.[10.ai-in-hiring.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/89d7c0c1-f275-4c09-93f4-8e75980dba27/10.ai-in-hiring.md)
