TASK 1 — Critic 1.4 (Corporate Learning Type 2 Problem) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/09.learning-in-companies.md Critique: The book recommends "public investment in corporate learning should be directed exclusively toward Type 1 and Type 3 models" but most corporate learning in practice is Type 2 (employer-curated). The gap between the normative recommendation and descriptive reality is not addressed. Action: Find where the Type 1/2/3 model distinction is discussed and where the public investment recommendation is made. Propose a 2-paragraph insert (~250 words) that acknowledges Type 2 dominates in practice, explains why this makes the recommendation harder but not wrong, and suggests transitional mechanisms (portability requirements, breadth standards) that make Type 2 investment less risky. Report the exact surrounding text for insertion.

TASK 2 — Critic 3.3 (Vendor Data in Corporate Learning) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/09.learning-in-companies.md Critique: Claims like "30–60% faster skill acquisition," "40% engagement improvement," "22% productivity increase from VR," and "95% accuracy in predicting attrition" all come from vendor case studies. The chapter flags this but the volume of vendor-sourced claims gives the chapter an uneven tone: the evidence caveat reads as a footnote while the claims read as the argument. Action: Find where the chapter first introduces vendor-sourced performance claims (likely in an AI/personalized learning section). Propose a front-loaded evidence paragraph (~150 words) that sets the frame BEFORE the claims appear — stating explicitly that the following section relies heavily on vendor-reported data and explaining why. Report the exact surrounding text for insertion.

TASK 3 — Critic 2.1 (Democratic Governance) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md Critique: The claim that "no society can sustain democratic governance" without university-based civic education is historically questionable. Functioning democracies predated mass higher education. Civic competence was historically cultivated through churches, unions, political parties, local assemblies, civic associations, military service, and journalism. Action: Find the exact passage making this claim. Propose a 1-paragraph insert (~200 words) immediately after it that acknowledges the historical record of non-university civic formation while sharpening the argument about universities' specific contemporary role (algorithmic literacy, source epistemology, deliberative practice in an era of information manipulation). Report the exact surrounding text for insertion.

TASK 1 — Critic 2.2 (Crucible Cost) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md Critique: The crucible chapter acknowledges that the proposed character-forming practices (residential cohorts, community projects, debate clubs, research labs) already exist at elite universities. The "selectivity paradox" response is that non-elite institutions must offer the same with more scaffolding, coaching, smaller cohorts. This is described as "more expensive, not less." But no cost estimate is provided. Without cost analysis, the proposal is aspirational. Action: Find where "more expensive, not less" or the selectivity paradox is discussed. Propose a 2-3 paragraph insert (~400 words) that provides a rough cost estimate per student (referencing CUNY ASAP at ~$3,500/student/year additional, and noting that full crucible features at non-elite institutions likely add $2,800–$3,800 per student annually — covering coaching ratios, smaller cohorts, community project coordination, and mental health support). Link this to the funding architecture discussed elsewhere in the chapter. Report the exact surrounding text for insertion.

TASK 2 — Critic 2.3 (Three Futures Unevenness) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/12.three-futures-for-education.md Critique: DRIFT and PLATFORM WORLD are described with strong evidence and detailed mechanisms. REDESIGN reads as the book's preferred prescription but its enabling mechanisms (political will, sustained public investment, multi-actor coordination) are less well-evidenced. The book's own evidence makes the preferred outcome appear less probable. Action: Find where the REDESIGN scenario is introduced or concludes. Propose a 2-paragraph insert (~300 words) that explicitly acknowledges Redesign is the hardest path and has the weakest precedent base, cites 2-3 real-world examples of partial Redesign (e.g., Singapore's SkillsFuture, UK credit frameworks, Austrian higher education reform), and reframes the difficulty as a reason for intentional investment rather than optimism. Report the exact surrounding text for insertion.

TASK 3 — Critic 2.4 (Intelligence Factory Metaphor) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/04.the-rise-of-the-intelligence-factory.md Critique: The metaphor implies total replacement but the analysis describes hybrid reality. The opening sections use provocative language before the chapter pivots to a nuanced hybrid framework. Action: Find the end of the first major provocative section (likely early in the chapter, before the hybrid analysis begins). Propose a short insert (~150 words, 1 paragraph) that signals upfront: the metaphor is deliberately provocative, the analysis that follows will show a hybrid reality, not total replacement. Report the exact surrounding text for insertion.

TASK 1 — Critic 3.2 (CBE Evidence Paradox) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/06.new-models-of-learning.md Critique: The most rigorous independent meta-review (2013) found "hardly any evidence for the effectiveness of CBE" after four decades. WGU and SNHU report strong outcomes. The book explains this via selection effects and institutional design — plausible but a hypothesis, not a finding. The book then proceeds to treat CBE as one of the promising models without adjusting its prescriptive weight. Action: Find where the CBE evidence discussion concludes (likely after mentioning the 2013 meta-review or WGU/SNHU outcomes). Propose a short insert (~150 words) that explicitly states: "We adopt CBE in this book as a plausible and partially validated direction, not as an evidence-based recommendation. The distinction matters for policymakers deciding where to invest." Report exact surrounding text.

TASK 2 — Critic 4.1 (Transfer Problem) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/06.new-models-of-learning.md Critique: The book notes skills don't transfer well from context-specific training, and Minerva/ECIU attempt cross-disciplinary reinforcement. But it doesn't systematically explore how to design for transfer in modular/CBE systems. Action: Find the "Transfer" discussion in the learning science section (around line 338). There should be a sentence saying the design problem "remains partially open." Propose a 3-paragraph insert (~400 words) after that sentence covering: (1) contextual variation — practice core competencies across 3-4 deliberately varied contexts; (2) metacognitive scaffolding — explicit "bridging" moments where students identify principles that connect contexts; (3) assessment that tests transfer (can the learner apply this in a new domain?), not just mastery in the training context. Reference David Perkins' work on far transfer. Report exact surrounding text.

TASK 3 — Critic 4.2 (Layer 4 Speculative) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/07.degrees-skills-and-the-signalling-stack.md Critique: Layer 4 "AI-derived behavioral patterns" is speculative. No system uses behavioral signals as a primary hiring input at scale. Including it as a named layer alongside observed phenomena overstates its current reality. Action: Find the Layer 4 section heading and opening paragraph. Propose a revision to the opening (~200 words) that clearly distinguishes Layers 1-3 (observed, documented) from Layer 4 (speculative, not yet operational at scale). Do not remove Layer 4 — reframe it as "a possible future layer" or "the speculative frontier." Report exact surrounding text.

TASK 1 — Critic 4.3 (Geographic Scope Inconsistent) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/42.methodological-note.md Critique: Some chapters are strongly European (University Alliances, Bologna Process, German funding models, EU AI Act). Others default heavily to US examples (WGU, SNHU, Guild Education, student debt). The transitions are not signaled. Action: Find the end of the current methodological note (it ends with a new section "The Diagnosis–Prescription Evidence Gap" that was recently added). Propose a new section "Geographic Scope" (~200 words) to be added AFTER the Diagnosis-Prescription section. It should state: the book draws primarily on OECD/European and North American examples; some chapters lean European (funding, alliances, regulation), others lean American (corporate learning, alternative models, student debt); the book signals these shifts where possible but readers should be aware of the geographic centre of gravity in each chapter. Report exact surrounding text.

TASK 2 — Critic 4.4 (Funding Model Applicability) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md Critique: The 50% cap on single revenue sources is US-centric. Nordic systems (70%+ public), UK post-2012 (52-53% tuition), German universities (55-65% Grundmittel) can't easily diversify. The principle is sound but the specific percentages are unrealistic for structurally mono-funded systems. Action: Find where the funding model section proposes the percentage targets or the "no single source should exceed 50%" principle. Propose a 2-paragraph insert (~300 words) that acknowledges: (1) this principle is derived from diversification logic that maps most naturally onto mixed-funding systems like the US and Australia; (2) for structurally mono-funded systems (Nordics, Germany, UK), the principle should be read as a diagnostic rather than a target — the question is not "can you get to 50%?" but "what happens to your institution when your dominant funder changes priorities?"; (3) the practical implication for mono-funded systems is building modest secondary revenue streams as resilience buffers, not wholesale restructuring. Report exact surrounding text.

TASK 3 — Critic 4.5 (Humanities Protection) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/11.universities-as-public-institutions.md Critique: The book argues for humanities and basic research but offers no mechanism to protect them when employer-alignment and enrollment-driven funding dominate. Action: Find the section discussing the university's role in cultural memory, humanities, or basic research (likely in a "design anchors" or "public mission" section). Propose a 3-paragraph insert (~400 words) after it describing concrete protective mechanisms: (1) earmarked research funding separated from enrollment (Germany's Exzellenzstrategie, Canada Research Chairs); (2) regulatory cross-subsidization — requiring institutions receiving public research funding to allocate minimum 15-20% to unfunded inquiry; (3) architectural separation of teaching and research budgets so enrollment decline doesn't automatically erode research capacity. Report exact surrounding text.

TASK 4 — Critic 5.2 (Faculty Resistance) File: /Users/mathis/dev/education-is-broken/education-is-broken-vault/book/chapters/05.how-systems-actually-change.md Critique: The book discusses institutional inertia but gives little attention to faculty resistance as a political force. Faculty unions and tenure structures are primary obstacles to reform in many European systems. The book treats institutional inertia as structural without naming its human agents (and their legitimate concerns about precarity, deskilling, and loss of autonomy). Action: Find a section discussing institutional inertia, barriers to change, or governance complexity (likely in the middle of the chapter). Propose a 2-paragraph insert (~300 words) that names faculty resistance explicitly: (1) acknowledges that faculty unions, tenure structures, and disciplinary identity are the primary political obstacles to curricular reform in many systems; (2) frames faculty concerns as partly legitimate — precarity, deskilling through AI, loss of professional autonomy are real threats; (3) argues that reform proposals that ignore faculty as political agents are incomplete, and that successful reform requires either faculty buy-in through co-design or sufficient political capital to override resistance.
