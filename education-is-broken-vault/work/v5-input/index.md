If you want, I can next:

- Expand this into a **full manuscript-ready chapter draft**,
    
- Map it directly into your existing chapter order,
    
- Add **academic citations and research integration**,
    
- Convert it into a **consultant/manager application framework**,
    
- Or create an **Agency diagnostic model and scoring tool** aligned with your book.
    

  

Just tell me which direction you want to take.
