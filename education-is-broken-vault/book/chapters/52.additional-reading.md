## Introductory Material

Accessible starting points for readers new to education reform, credentialism, and alternative learning.

## Divergent and Opposing Views

Sources that challenge, complicate, or directly contradict the book's arguments. Included in the interest of intellectual honesty.

- **Andrew Delbanco, *College: What It Was, Is, and Should Be* (2012).** A defense of the liberal arts college as a space for civic formation and intellectual maturation, arguing that instrumental critiques of higher education miss its deeper purpose.

- **Johann Neem, *What's the Point of College?* (2019).** Argues that the university's value lies precisely in its separation from labor market pressures, pushing back against the skills-and-employability framing.

- **Fuller and Raman, "Dismissed by Degrees" (Harvard Business School, 2017).** While often cited in favor of skills-based hiring, the report also documents the real risks: skills-based screening can disadvantage workers who lack professional networks, and employers frequently revert to degree requirements under uncertainty.

- **Ben Williamson, *Big Data in Education* (2017).** A critical analysis of how data-driven and AI approaches in education risk reducing learning to measurable behaviors, entrenching surveillance, and serving commercial rather than pedagogical interests.

- **Cathy O'Neil, *Weapons of Math Destruction* (2016).** Documents how algorithmic decision-making in education, hiring, and public services amplifies inequality. A counterpoint to optimistic accounts of AI in hiring (Chapter 8).

- **Eric Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann, *The Knowledge Capital of Nations* (2015).** Argues that cognitive skills (as measured by standardized tests) are the strongest predictor of economic growth, providing an evidence-based defense of rigorous assessment that challenges the book's skepticism toward testing.

- **Matthew Crawford, *The Case for Working with Your Hands* (2009).** Argues that the push toward cognitive and digital work devalues skilled trades and embodied knowledge, complicating the book's emphasis on digital credentials and AI-mediated learning.

- **David Deming, "The Growing Importance of Social Skills in the Labor Market" (2017), *Quarterly Journal of Economics*.** While broadly compatible with the book's argument about non-cognitive skills, Deming's work also shows that traditional degree programs remain effective at developing the social skills employers value most.
