# Introduction

This book was not the book I set out to write.

It was almost an afterthought in another project in my current general work track *Human Work in Times of AI* and I started with a narrower question: what happens to human labor when artificial intelligence absorbs the routine cognitive tasks that have been the backbone of white-collar careers for decades? That question led, quickly and inevitably, to education. If AI replaces the entry-level analytical work through which junior professionals used to develop into experienced ones, then the pipeline that produces competent seniors — the people who can exercise judgment, oversee AI systems, and serve as sparring partners for complex decisions — is in danger of drying up. The practical implication seemed straightforward: we need to rethink how we train people for the labor market.

That was the starting hypothesis. It did not survive contact with the material.

## How the question changed

In software development, there is a phenomenon called *feature drift*: small, incremental changes accumulate unnoticed until, one day, you realize the product has become something fundamentally different from what was originally designed. Something similar happened here. The more I investigated what "better training" would look like, the more the question shifted beneath me. It moved from *Ausbildung* — training, the preparation for a specific job — to *Bildung* — education in the broader sense, the development of a person's capacity to think, judge, adapt, and take responsibility in a world that does not hold still.

My doctoral supervisor, the architect Fritz Haller, used to describe this kind of experience with a phrase borrowed from Zen practice: *Ich zeichne nicht — es zeichnet mit mir.* I am not drawing — it is drawing with me. The subject matter had its own logic, and it pulled the inquiry in a direction I had not anticipated.

Once the question became *what is good education?*, rather than merely *what is effective training?*, the scope expanded considerably. Suddenly the investigation had to address not just skills and employability, but agency — the capacity to direct one's own learning and life. It had to contend with the role of institutions: whether universities are service providers or public trust organizations, and what follows from each answer. It had to examine how credentials actually function as social signals, and who benefits when those signals change. It had to confront stratification — the persistent, structural ways in which educational systems reproduce inequality even as they promise to reduce it. And it had to take seriously the possibility that education's purpose is not reducible to economic output at all, but extends to democratic participation, social cohesion, and the ability to navigate a life under conditions that no one can fully predict.

## The evidence problem

Readers who are used to well-established fields will find the evidentiary landscape here uneven. The diagnosis of what is broken in contemporary education — rising costs, credential inflation, persistent skills gaps, widening equity divides — rests on solid ground: large-scale data, cross-national comparisons, meta-analyses. The picture is clear enough.

The prescriptive side is a different matter. Studies on emerging models — AI tutoring, competency-based education, micro-credentials, employer-led learning platforms — contradict each other, sometimes fundamentally. One rigorous review finds that AI-assisted instruction accelerates learning; another, equally rigorous, finds no significant effect or raises concerns about shallow engagement. I believe this is largely because the field is too new. The technologies are developing faster than the evaluation cycles, and many published findings may represent interim snapshots of systems that have since changed.

This has shaped the book in two ways. First, I have included claims that are less than fully established, particularly from Tier 3 and Tier 4 evidence — single-institution pilots, vendor-reported data, industry surveys with variable methodology. I have done so because ignoring this material would leave the picture incomplete. But I have tried to flag the evidence quality transparently, both inline and in a dedicated Methodological Note in the appendix. Second, I have treated the uncertainty itself as a finding. As the proverb goes: the most unreliable predictions are those about the future. Rather than pretending that the evidence supports confident prescriptions, the book maps possibilities and trade-offs, and asks readers to weigh them with appropriate caution.

## What this book covers

The argument unfolds in twelve chapters. The first sets the normative frame: a manifesto that establishes the commitments against which everything else should be measured. The next chapters map the terrain — what is broken and for whom, why agency is the bottleneck that most reform proposals overlook, how AI is unbundling functions that universities have held together for centuries. From there, the book examines how systems actually change (and why they resist change), surveys emerging models of learning, analyses the shifting landscape of credentials and signaling, and confronts the stratification dynamics that threaten to make every promising innovation work well for the privileged and poorly for everyone else. Separate chapters address corporate learning, AI in hiring, and the contested role of universities as public institutions. The final chapter constructs three plausible futures — not predictions, but structured scenarios that make visible what is at stake in the choices being made now.

## Scope and limits

The focus is on higher education and corporate learning — what happens after school. This is a deliberate limitation. Many of the problems discussed here, particularly unequal selection and the uneven distribution of agency, have their roots in primary and secondary education. I am aware of this. But addressing those roots adequately would require a different book. The systemic failures of school education deserve sustained treatment by people with the relevant expertise. I have resisted the temptation to fold them in superficially.

The geographic center of gravity is Europe and North America, with targeted examples from other regions. This is partly a function of data availability, partly a function of my own professional context. The Methodological Note discusses these limitations in detail.

## Where I come from

A note on perspective. I am not an education researcher by training. My academic career was that of a research assistant — I worked in research at a German university and built an IT curriculum for architecture students. There is a certain irony in the fact that my doctoral thesis addressed an AI topic in engineering design: this was symbolic AI, before the first AI winter, and it bears little resemblance to the systems that are now reshaping the labor market and the classroom. My subsequent career has been in consulting, training, and organizational design, and the question of how complex organizations adapt under uncertainty — a subject I have addressed in a previous book on strategic adaptivity.

I mention this not as a disclaimer but as context. The questions I bring to education are those of someone who has spent decades thinking about how systems learn, fail to learn, and resist learning — in organizations, not in classrooms. That perspective has shaped what I notice and what I miss. Whether it is a useful lens, the reader will judge.

## The central claim

Through all the feature drift, one conviction solidified and became the backbone of the book:

**Education exists to develop human agency and the cohesion of society under conditions of uncertainty.** Everything else — credentials, skills, employability, innovation, even economic growth — are secondary outcomes, not first principles.

This claim is sharpened into five non-negotiable commitments in the manifesto that follows. It is against that standard — not efficiency, not disruption, not market relevance — that every argument, every model, and every proposed future in this book should be measured.

# A Manifesto for Education in the Age of AI

> Education is not broken because it has failed to keep up with technology.
> It is broken because it has lost clarity about what it is _for_.

The Manifesto


This book starts from a simple claim: **education exists to develop human agency and the cohesion of society under conditions of uncertainty**. Everything else—credentials, skills, employability, innovation, even growth—are secondary outcomes, not first principles.

In an age where intelligence can be manufactured at scale, the purpose of education cannot be the efficient transmission of information. That problem has been solved. The purpose must instead be to cultivate the capacities that cannot be automated: **judgment, responsibility, agency, and the ability to act wisely in complex, contested, and changing worlds**.

From this follow five non-negotiable commitments.

### 1. Judgment over recall

When answers are abundant, the scarce resource is discernment.

Education must shift its center of gravity from memorization to judgment: the ability to frame good questions, evaluate competing claims, integrate evidence, and decide under uncertainty. Systems that optimize for test performance, content coverage, or credential throughput at the expense of judgment are failing their core mission—even if they appear efficient.

AI should be used to _support_ judgment, not replace it.

### 2. Agency before access

Access without agency is not empowerment—it is exposure.

Expanding access to learning tools is necessary but insufficient. Education systems must actively **build the capacity to learn**, not merely provide resources. This includes self-regulation, metacognition, ethical reasoning, and the courage to take responsibility for one’s learning trajectory.

Any system that scales content faster than it builds agency will increase inequality, not reduce it.

### 3. Education is about Navigating Lives

Labor-market relevance matters—but it is not enough.

Education must prepare people not only to _get jobs_, but to **navigate lives**: to adapt when roles change, to resist manipulation, to participate in democratic societies, and to exercise moral judgment when incentives point the wrong way.

Reducing education to employability metrics hollows out the public justification for universities and invites corporate capture of learning pathways.

### 4. Institutions matter because power matters

Markets optimize for efficiency, not for fairness. Left unchecked, they concentrate advantage, externalize social costs, and erode the public goods -- equal opportunity, social cohesion, democratic participation -- that no individual market actor is incentivized to protect. This is not a flaw in markets; it is what markets do. 

The corrective has always been institutional: governments, regulators, and public bodies that set boundaries, redistribute access, and hold the line on values that markets cannot price. When those institutions retreat or fail to keep pace, market logic fills the vacuum -- and the common interest loses its seat at the table.

In this sense, Universities are not merely service providers. They are public trust institutions responsible for truth-seeking, academic freedom, and the preservation of cultural and scientific memory. These functions require governance, slowness, and resistance to short-term optimization.

AI systems should inform institutional judgment—not replace it. Decisions about what counts as knowledge, competence, and merit must remain human, accountable, and contestable.

### 5. Trade-offs must be made explicit

There is no neutral redesign.

Every educational reform privileges some values over others: speed over deliberation, flexibility over stability, personalization over shared standards. Pretending otherwise is dishonest.

This book rejects the fantasy of painless transformation. Some traditions must be abandoned. Some efficiencies must be refused. Some innovations must be constrained. The measure of success is not disruption, but **whether the redesigned system produces people capable of using powerful tools without becoming tools themselves**.

### The anchor

If education has a single obligation in the age of AI, it is this:

> **To ensure that as intelligence becomes cheaper, human judgment and agency becomes stronger.**

Everything that follows in this book—its analysis, its warnings, its proposed futures—should be read against that standard.
