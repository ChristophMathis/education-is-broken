# Agency: The Missing Infrastructure

**Why Access Without Direction Produces Inequality, Not Opportunity**

The previous chapter documented what is broken. This one names what must be built in its place.

If education exists to develop human agency — and that is the central claim of this book — then we need to be precise about what agency actually is, why it matters more now than it did a generation ago, and what it takes to build it in people who do not yet have it. Because the uncomfortable truth running through everything that follows in this book is this: every promising model we will examine works brilliantly for learners who already possess strong agency, and fails — sometimes quietly, sometimes spectacularly — for those who do not.

This is not a chapter about psychology. It is a chapter about the design constraint that every educational institution, every AI learning platform, and every policy reform must confront if it wants to do more than sort people by privilege and call it merit.

## What Agency Is — and What It Is Not

Agency is the capacity to direct your own learning, set goals, persist through difficulty, and adapt when things do not work. It means the discipline to sit down and work when no one is watching. It means knowing the difference between using an AI tutor to accelerate your understanding and using it to generate an essay you never read. It means tolerating frustration, asking for help without shame, and keeping going when a problem resists easy solutions.

This sounds like a personality trait. It is not.

Agency is built. It is built through years of experience, modelling, and support. Children who grow up in stable homes with educated parents, consistent routines, access to books and mentors, and low levels of chronic stress develop the self-regulation skills that agency requires earlier and more robustly. Children who grow up in poverty, chaos, or neglect — through no fault of their own — often arrive at education with weaker self-regulation, not because they are less capable, but because their environments gave them fewer opportunities to build those muscles (Zimmerman 2002; Deci and Ryan 2000).

This distinction matters enormously for how we design educational systems.

If agency is an innate trait, then institutions that select for it are acting rationally. If agency is a socially produced capacity — and the evidence overwhelmingly says it is — then institutions that select for it are repackaging privilege as merit.

Agency also needs to be distinguished from several things it is frequently confused with.

**It is not motivation.** A student can be highly motivated and still lack the ability to structure their learning, manage their time, or recover from setbacks. Motivation is the desire to act. Agency is the capacity to act effectively and sustain that action over time.

**It is not autonomy.** Autonomy is the freedom to choose. Agency includes the competence to choose well. Giving a struggling learner unlimited freedom to design their own curriculum is not empowerment — it is abandonment.

**It is not self-efficacy.** Believing you can succeed is important. But belief without the skills to plan, monitor, and adjust your own learning does not produce results. A student can feel confident and still be unable to diagnose why they are stuck.

**It is not competence.** A person can possess skills and knowledge but lack the capacity to deploy them independently. Agency is what turns dormant competence into directed action.

What makes agency distinctive is that it integrates all of these. It is the operating system that coordinates motivation, skill, belief, and self-regulation into sustained, self-directed behaviour. Researchers in self-regulated learning have documented this for decades: effective learners cycle through planning, monitoring, and reflection repeatedly — setting goals, tracking their progress, identifying what is not working, and adjusting (Zimmerman 2002; Pintrich 2000). Agency is essentially the reliable execution of this cycle across increasingly complex challenges.

The reason this matters for the argument of this book is straightforward. Every chapter that follows describes models and technologies that assume learners can run this cycle on their own. AI tutoring platforms assume it. Competency-based education assumes it. Self-paced micro-credential systems assume it. Peer-driven coding schools assume it. And when that assumption fails — when a learner cannot plan, cannot monitor, cannot reflect, cannot adjust — the model does not adapt to the learner. The learner simply falls out.

Agency is the load-bearing wall. If it is missing, everything built on top of it collapses.

## Why Agency Becomes the Bottleneck Now

Agency has always mattered. What has changed is that it has become the primary differentiator between learners who benefit from new educational possibilities and those who are harmed by them.

For most of the twentieth century, educational systems managed the agency problem through structure. Compulsory attendance, fixed schedules, prescribed curricula, teacher-led instruction, and regular deadlines created an external scaffolding that carried learners through the process whether they had strong self-direction or not. You did not need much agency to progress through a system that told you where to be, what to study, and when to submit your work. The system did the directing. The student did the complying.

This was not ideal for learning. It suppressed curiosity, rewarded compliance over initiative, and bored high-performing students while leaving struggling students too little room to develop at their own pace. But it had one underappreciated virtue: it did not require learners to bring their own agency as an entry condition.

Now consider what happens as education shifts toward the models described in this book.

AI tutoring platforms offer infinite patience, immediate feedback, and personalised pathways — but they require the learner to show up, ask the right questions, and persist when the material gets hard. There is no bell, no classroom, no teacher scanning the room for the student who has gone quiet.

Competency-based programmes let you move at your own pace — but "your own pace" for a student without self-regulation skills often means no pace at all. Western Governors University, which has served over 350,000 students through competency-based models, has struggled to produce robust evidence that CBE actually improves learning outcomes. A 2015 meta-review concluded that despite the approach emerging in the 1970s, "there is hardly any evidence for the effectiveness of competence-based education" (Morcke, Dornan, and Eika 2013). The students who succeed in these environments tend to be those who would have succeeded anyway.

Micro-credential systems offer flexibility and modularity — but navigating a landscape of stackable certificates, choosing which ones matter, and assembling them into a coherent career trajectory requires exactly the directional capacity that the most vulnerable learners lack.

The pattern is consistent. The same features that make a model exciting for high-agency learners — flexibility, self-pacing, personalisation, freedom — make it treacherous for everyone else.

We have already seen this play out. Massive Open Online Courses were supposed to democratise education a decade ago. The data tells a different story: completion rates hovered around 5–10 per cent, and the people who completed courses were overwhelmingly those who already held degrees (Reich and Ruipérez-Valiente 2019). The tool was free and open. The benefit flowed upward.

AI tutoring platforms are more sophisticated than MOOCs, but the underlying dynamic is the same. A tool that requires the user to bring direction, persistence, and critical judgment will systematically advantage those who already have these qualities — and those qualities correlate with socioeconomic background, parental education, and the quality of prior schooling.

This creates what we call the **agency divide**: the emerging inequality not between those who have access to learning and those who do not, but between those who can convert access into learning and those who cannot.

The agency divide is more insidious than the traditional digital divide because it is invisible. Two students can sit in front of the same AI tutor. One uses it to master organic chemistry in half the time. The other uses it to get through homework as fast as possible — or not at all. Both had "access." Only one had the conditions to convert access into learning.

And AI can make this worse in a way that previous technologies could not. When a learner uses AI to avoid thinking rather than to deepen it, the tool does not resist. It complies. It generates the essay, solves the problem, produces the answer. A textbook at least required the student to read. An AI tutor, used without agency, can do the learning for you — and the learner may not even notice what they have lost.

This is the paradox that every remaining chapter in this book must confront: **more opportunity, distributed without the infrastructure to use it, becomes more inequality**.

## How Agency Is Built — and What Prevents It

If agency is the bottleneck, then the central question for educational design becomes: how do you build it?

The research base here is substantial, even if educational practice has been slow to absorb it. Three decades of work on self-regulated learning — primarily by Zimmerman (2002), Pintrich (2000), and their successors — converge on a consistent finding: agency develops through repeated cycles of guided challenge, feedback, and reflection. It does not develop through instruction alone, and it does not develop through unstructured freedom.

This matters because the two most common approaches to agency in educational institutions are both wrong.

The first wrong approach is to ignore agency entirely — to treat it as the student's problem. This is the default in most traditional systems. The curriculum is delivered, assessments are administered, and students are expected to bring whatever self-regulation they need from home. Those who have it progress. Those who do not are labelled unmotivated, underprepared, or unsuitable. The institution has done its part; the failure belongs to the learner.

The second wrong approach is to leap to full autonomy — to give students "ownership of their learning" without building the capacity that ownership requires. This is the trap that many progressive and technology-driven models fall into. They mistake the endpoint for the starting point. Self-direction is the goal of education, not its prerequisite.

What the research actually shows is that agency develops through **scaffolded progression**: a deliberate, staged movement from high structure to increasing independence.

In practice, this means something specific. A first-year student who has never managed their own learning needs structured deadlines, explicit instruction on how to break problems into manageable pieces, regular check-ins with a mentor, and clear feedback on what is and is not working. The structure is not a constraint on their development — it is the condition for it. As the student demonstrates they can plan, monitor, and adjust on their own, the scaffolding is gradually removed. By the third year, the same student might be running independent projects with minimal guidance — not because they were born self-directed, but because the institution invested in building that capacity.

This is not a new idea. Vygotsky described the zone of proximal development a century ago. Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory (2000) established that autonomy supports learning only when accompanied by competence and relatedness — connection to others who care about your progress. What is new is the urgency. As education moves toward models that assume self-direction, the cost of failing to build it rises dramatically.

Four conditions, specifically, must be present for agency to develop.

**Structured challenge with immediate feedback.** Agency grows when learners face problems that are hard enough to require effort but not so hard that they produce helplessness. The feedback must be prompt enough to be useful — not a grade returned three weeks later, but a signal that lets the learner adjust in real time. AI can be genuinely powerful here, providing the kind of rapid, personalised feedback that a single teacher with thirty students cannot. But only if the learner is in a position to use that feedback, which requires the other three conditions.

**Explicit metacognitive instruction.** Most educational programmes treat the skills of learning itself — how to set realistic goals, how to diagnose why you are stuck, how to manage your time, how to ask for help — as if learners arrive with them fully formed. They do not. These are teachable skills, as teachable as mathematics or writing. An institution serious about building agency would dedicate real course time to metacognition — treating it with the same rigour it gives to its subject matter, not as a workshop sandwiched into orientation week (Flavell 1979; Schraw and Dennison 1994).

**Human mentorship and accountability.** Self-paced, algorithm-driven systems cannot notice when a learner is silently struggling. A mentor can. This does not mean surveillance or returning to traditional lectures. It means building relationships — regular check-ins where mentors know learners well enough to spot when someone is disengaging, when the self-pacing is moving at the wrong speed, when external stress is making self-direction impossible. For learners from backgrounds where self-direction is less developed, these relationships are not luxuries. They are prerequisites.

**Emotional and psychological stability.** A learner battling depression does not lack agency. They lack the internal bandwidth that agency requires. When nearly half of incoming students report persistent sadness or hopelessness — as a 2023 CDC survey found among U.S. high school students — any model that does not invest in mental health support is not building agency. It is filtering for learners resilient enough to overcome isolation on their own.

These four conditions are expensive. They require smaller class sizes, more instructor contact time, dedicated mentorship infrastructure, and comprehensive wellbeing services. They cost more than a lecture hall and an AI platform. And they fall disproportionately on the institutions that serve the students most likely to benefit from them — lower-income students, first-generation learners, students in under-resourced regions.

This creates the perverse dynamic at the heart of the equity problem: the students who most need agency-building support cannot attend the institutions that have the budgets to provide it.

Now consider what actively prevents agency from developing.

Most traditional educational systems do not merely fail to build agency — they suppress it. Rigid curricular pathways that leave no room for choice. Time-based progression models that move everyone at the same speed regardless of readiness. High-stakes summative assessments that punish error rather than treating it as information. Reward systems that value compliance over initiative, correct answers over good questions, and obedience over independent thinking.

In the German context, this is particularly visible. The early tracking of students into Gymnasium, Realschule, and Hauptschule at age ten sorts children by perceived ability at an age when their self-regulation capacities are still developing — and those capacities are distributed along socioeconomic lines. A child from an educated household with books, routines, and parental engagement is more likely to demonstrate the behaviours that earn a Gymnasium recommendation. A child from a less stable background, equally intelligent but with fewer opportunities to develop self-regulation, is more likely to be tracked into a pathway that offers less autonomy, less challenge, and less opportunity to develop the agency that the system claims to reward. The tracking does not discover ability. It reflects background — and then locks the result in place.

The irony is severe. The system that most needs to build agency in students who lack it is structured to deny those students the environments where agency develops.

## Design Principles for What Follows

This book examines many models: AI tutoring platforms, competency-based education, peer-driven schools, employer-sponsored learning, micro-credential systems, and various institutional hybrids. Each of them will be assessed on its own terms — what it promises, what it delivers, who it serves, and who it excludes.

But running beneath all of those assessments are three questions that this chapter has established, and that every remaining chapter must answer.

**First: Does the model treat agency as an entry requirement or a learning outcome?**

This is the sharpest diagnostic. A model that selects for self-directed learners and celebrates their success is not expanding opportunity — it is filtering for privilege and calling it merit. A model that deliberately builds self-direction in learners who arrive without it is doing the harder, more expensive, and more genuinely transformative work.

When we examine 42 School, Minerva, Western Governors University, and others in later chapters, this will be the first question we ask. Not "does it work?" but "for whom does it work, and what happens to everyone else?"

**Second: Who bears the cost when agency is absent — the institution or the learner?**

In most current systems, the answer is the learner. If you cannot self-direct, you drop out. If you drop out, you carry the debt without the credential. The institution reports a retention rate; you report a setback that may take years to recover from.

An equitable system would distribute that cost differently. It would invest upfront in the scaffolding, mentorship, and mental health support that prevent the dropout in the first place — rather than optimising for the students who need the least help and accepting the loss of everyone else as an acceptable rate of attrition.

This is expensive. The chapters on financing and institutional design will confront that cost directly. But the cost of not investing is also real — it is just borne by individuals and societies rather than appearing on institutional budgets.

**Third: How does the model move learners from dependence to independence?**

The endpoint of education is a person who can direct their own learning, their own career, and their own contribution to society. But the path to that endpoint cannot begin at that endpoint. It must begin with structure, guidance, and support — and it must gradually, deliberately, and measurably reduce that support as the learner develops the capacity to proceed without it.

Any model that offers only structure (traditional lecture-based education) fails because it never develops independence. Any model that offers only freedom (pure self-paced, algorithm-driven learning) fails because it assumes an independence that does not yet exist.

The models that work — and we will find some in the chapters ahead — are the ones that manage this transition deliberately: high scaffolding early, progressive autonomy over time, with clear markers for when a learner is ready for more independence and support for when they are not.

These three questions are not the only lens through which we will evaluate what follows. Cost, scalability, labour-market fit, and institutional governance all matter. But agency is the load-bearing wall. If a model does not address it, everything else is decoration.

One final point. There is a risk in making agency central that we must name honestly.

If agency becomes the new metric by which learners are judged, it can become the new mechanism of exclusion — the latest way to blame individuals for systemic failures. A student who drops out of a self-paced programme is not demonstrating a "lack of agency." They may be demonstrating a lack of support, a lack of stability, or a system that was designed for someone else.

Similarly, highly personalised algorithmic systems can create the appearance of agency — giving learners choices, tracking their preferences, adjusting difficulty — while quietly directing behaviour in ways that serve the platform's goals rather than the learner's development. This is pseudo-agency: the illusion of self-direction within a system that has already decided where you are going.

And continuous self-direction without community or structure can produce its own pathology. Decision fatigue, burnout, and the anxiety of perpetual self-optimisation are not signs that a learner lacks agency. They are signs that the system has placed too much weight on individual shoulders without providing the collective infrastructure that sustained effort requires.

Agency is the goal. But it is a goal that can only be reached through institutions willing to invest in the conditions that make it possible — not through systems that demand it as the price of admission.

The next chapter examines the force that makes all of this urgent: the rise of manufacturable intelligence, and what it means for the institutions that have traditionally held the monopoly on learning.
