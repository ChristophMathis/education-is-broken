# What Exactly Is Broken?

Everyone seems to agree that education is broken. Politicians say it. Employers say it. Students feel it. Parents worry about it. But when you press people to explain what "broken" actually means, the answers scatter in every direction. Some point to cost. Others point to irrelevance. Others still talk about fairness, or mental health, or the fact that a four-year degree no longer guarantees anything it once promised.

If you are picking up this book, you have probably felt it already: something about education no longer fits the world we live in. A degree costs more than a car, new skills go out of date in a few years, and many students and workers feel anxious, burnt out, or simply lost.

At the same time, extraordinary new possibilities have appeared. A teenager in a small town can learn advanced math from an AI tutor at midnight. A nurse can take an online micro-course and qualify for new responsibilities at work. A 40-year-old programmer can retrain for a new role using employer-funded learning, guided by recommendation systems that feel closer to Netflix than to school.

So is education broken -- or is it being rebuilt? The honest answer is: both. The old structures are under strain, but the new ones are uneven, confusing, and sometimes unfair.

This chapter tries to pin the problem down. Before we can talk about solutions -- and this book is full of them, some promising, some dangerous, some both -- we need a shared understanding of what is actually failing, for whom, and why.

## Four dimensions of brokenness

When we say education is broken, we are really talking about four things at once. Each one matters on its own, but together they form a system that is failing on multiple fronts simultaneously.
### 1. Learning outcomes

The most basic question is: are people actually learning? The evidence is not reassuring.

Globally, the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF have documented what they call "learning poverty" -- children and young people who attend school but cannot read, write, or do basic math at the level expected for their age. This is not a problem confined to the developing world. In wealthy countries, standardised assessments consistently show stagnant or declining performance in foundational skills, even as spending per student has risen.

In higher education, the picture is more nuanced but still troubling. Students increasingly view themselves as consumers who feel entitled to high grades by virtue of paying tuition -- a mindset that research has linked to lower academic performance and weaker critical thinking skills. Grade inflation, where institutions award higher marks without corresponding improvements in learning, has become widespread. Teachers feel pressured to inflate grades to avoid negative student evaluations, and administrators are sometimes incentivised to manipulate statistics to maintain funding rather than to improve actual education.

Meanwhile, standardised testing -- the main tool governments use to measure learning at scale -- is itself contested. Critics argue that state-mandated assessments measure narrow abilities rather than genuine cognitive growth. If the tests are flawed, the data they produce is flawed, and the policies built on that data are built on sand.

The result is a system that produces credentials without reliably producing competence. A degree says you finished something. It does not always say you learned something.

### 2. Equity

Education is supposed to be the great equaliser. In practice, it often reinforces the gaps it claims to close.

Affordability challenges and high debt burdens disproportionately affect lower-income and marginalised students, undermining equity and social mobility goals (OECD 2025a). In Europe, rapid expansion of tertiary attainment has improved overall participation rates, but persistent inequalities by socio-economic status, migrant background, and region continue to challenge the promise of fair access in both public and private institutions (OECD 2025b).

The digital divide adds another layer. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, poorer households with limited connectivity saw their children fall further behind. The loss was not temporary. Without intervention, those gaps compound over time, narrowing future opportunities for the students who could least afford to lose ground.

Neurodivergent learners remain underserved by mainstream systems that demand conformity rather than providing specialised support. These students often need environments that allow for what researchers call "unmasking" -- the ability to learn in ways that match how their minds actually work, rather than forcing adaptation to a system designed for a narrow definition of normal.

And as AI-powered learning tools become more available, a new kind of inequality may be emerging -- not based on access to information, but on the agency and discipline to use it. When learning is abundant, the advantage is likely to go to those with the self-direction to build and iterate, rather than to be passively entertained or overwhelmed. If this pattern holds, the divide will fall between those who use these tools as thought partners and those who use them to avoid thinking altogether.

### 3. Cost

A degree now costs more than a car in many countries. In the United States, student debt has become a defining feature of an entire generation's economic life. In Europe, while tuition for domestic students is often lower or even free at public universities, the real costs are still rising: living expenses, opportunity costs, and the growing reliance on fees charged to non-EU students to balance institutional budgets (EHEA 2024).

Behind the scenes, institutions face their own financial crisis. Shrinking public funding, rising operating costs, and dependence on tuition make financial sustainability a central risk, especially for small and mid-tier institutions (Goedmo 2025). Growing costs for healthcare, mental health services, compliance, and infrastructure -- labs, housing, digital systems -- outpace available revenue sources (Deloitte 2025).

Many universities respond with tuition hikes, programme cuts, staff reductions, or even closures, which can further erode access and public confidence (Changing Higher Ed 2025). This creates a vicious cycle: costs rise, public trust falls, enrolment drops, revenues shrink, and institutions cut further. The small and mid-tier schools caught in this spiral are the ones that often serve the students who most need affordable education.

The cost problem is not just about price. It is about whether the price is justified by what you get in return. And for a growing number of students and families, the answer is no longer obvious.

### 4. Labour-market fit

Students and families increasingly question the return on investment of a degree, given high tuition, student debt, and uncertain job outcomes (KPMG 2020). And their scepticism is grounded in reality.

Employers report persistent skills gaps, especially in digital, STEM, and transversal skills -- communication, teamwork, adaptability -- that curricula often fail to deliver quickly enough (OECD 2025a). Slow academic governance can delay curriculum updates, making programmes feel outdated compared to fast-moving labour-market demands and alternative credentials (ASU and UDI 2024).

The half-life of a skill is shrinking. A four-year fixed curriculum is structurally outdated before a student even finishes it. What was cutting-edge when a student enrolled may be standard practice -- or obsolete -- by the time they graduate. This is especially true in technology-adjacent fields, but it increasingly applies across the board. Healthcare protocols change. Regulatory frameworks evolve. Business models shift. The pace of change has outrun the pace of curriculum development.

Meanwhile, companies are shifting their valuation of education. They increasingly look for demonstrated capability -- portfolios, projects, and evidence of value creation -- rather than relying solely on degrees as proxies for competence. Companies do not hire degrees; they hire the signal that a candidate can think, produce value, and finish hard things. Because AI is making it cheaper to verify skills through projects, simulations, and portfolios, the degree appears to be shifting from a gate to a preference -- though the pace and extent of this shift remain uncertain.

The question is moving from "What school did you go to?" to "What can you actually do?" That is a profound shift, and the educational system has not caught up with it.

## Where this book focuses -- and where it does not

This book is primarily about two domains: higher education and corporate learning. These are the places where the brokenness is most visible, where the most money is at stake, and where the most dramatic experiments in reform are underway. We also spend significant time on recruiting and hiring, because that is where education meets the labour market and where credentials are tested against real jobs.

We are not writing a book about primary and secondary schooling, though K-12 problems are deeply relevant. Many of the failures in higher education -- remedial classes, disengaged students, shallow preparation -- trace back to what happened (or did not happen) in earlier years. The global crisis of learning poverty, documented by the World Bank and its partners, is fundamentally a K-12 problem that casts a long shadow over everything that follows. We will reference it where it matters, but a thorough treatment of school systems would require a different book.

Similarly, while we discuss AI and technology throughout, this is not a technology book. It is a book about people and institutions trying to adapt to a world that is changing faster than their structures allow.

## What is our actual claim?

Before we move on, it is worth stating plainly what we think is actually broken, and what we think is actually possible.

When we say education is broken, we do not mean that the entire system is beyond repair. Rather, we mean that the foundational bargains that held the old system together -- knowledge is scarce and valuable, institutions control access to that knowledge, a degree signals competence and opens doors -- have deteriorated faster than institutions have been able to adapt. The system was designed for a world where information was expensive and slow; it is now operating in a world where information is abundant and fast. That mismatch creates failures across every dimension we have described. But mismatch is not permanent. It can be addressed.

Our argument has three parts. **First:** the brokenness is real and structural, not merely cyclical or superficial. The problems in learning outcomes, equity, cost, and labour-market fit are not the result of bad leadership at individual institutions; they flow from the institutions themselves being designed for conditions that no longer exist. **Second:** the brokenness is not uniform. It falls differently on different people, different institutions, and different geographies. A failure that is systemic in one context can be an opportunity in another. **Third, and most importantly:** the brokenness is not destiny. But fixing it requires more than tinkering with curriculum or adopting new technology. It requires institutions and societies to make explicit choices about what education is *for*, and to align structures, incentives, and resources with those choices. Some institutions will make those choices and adapt. Others will not. Some will adapt to serve their existing students and communities better; others will adapt to serve new markets and demographics. These are not neutral moves. They have winners and losers.

This book is about the choices ahead -- what they are, who is making them, what they might lead to, and what is at stake. We focus on three domains: higher education, workplace learning, and hiring. Within these domains, we concentrate on OECD and European contexts, with particular attention to the United States and Europe, where the forces of change are most visible and where the most capital (financial and cultural) is invested in education. Our analysis applies most directly to tertiary education and professional-level corporate learning, though the underlying patterns often trace back to K-12 failures and ripple outward into lifelong learning. We do not try to fix everything at once. We try to diagnose what is actually broken, show what is actually changing, and help readers -- whether they are students, parents, educators, administrators, policymakers, or employers -- think more clearly about how to act in a system in transition.

The overall claim is this: education is broken because the structures are out of sync with the world. The system can be repaired, but not through incremental change. It requires explicit choice, disciplined execution, and genuine acceptance of trade-offs. Some of what is happening now is progress. Some is predatory. Most is somewhere in between. Our job is to help readers tell the difference, and to understand what is at stake when they choose which direction to move.

## Who feels the brokenness: seven groups, seven experiences

The problems we have described do not land equally on everyone. Education involves at least seven distinct groups of stakeholders, and each one experiences the system's failures differently. Understanding these different perspectives is essential, because a reform that helps one group can easily harm another.

### Students

Students are at the centre of the system, but they are often the least powerful actors within it. They are currently processed in batches -- taught at a speed that bores top performers and leaves struggling learners behind -- and assessed through static grades that provide a snapshot of performance rather than a picture of growth.

In higher education, students face a painful bind. They pay more than ever for degrees whose labour-market value is increasingly uncertain. Many experience financial stress, mental health difficulties, and disengagement, all of which increase dropout risk (SeatsOne 2025).

Specific populations are hit harder. Neurodivergent learners are critical stakeholders often underserved by mandatory integration in mainstream schools, requiring environments that allow for specialised support rather than forced adaptation. First-generation students, students from low-income families, and students with migrant backgrounds face compounding barriers that the system was never designed to address.

The consumer mindset -- "I paid for this, so I deserve a good grade" -- is itself a symptom of brokenness. When students see education primarily as a transaction, something has already gone wrong with the value proposition. But it is hard to blame them. When a degree costs what a house deposit used to cost, treating it as a product is a rational response to an irrational system.

### Teachers and educators

Teachers are asked to do more with less, and the strain is showing. The role is shifting from being a broadcaster of information to being a designer of learning experiences, acting as mentors, coaches, and guardians of standards. This is a more demanding job, not a less demanding one.

Yet educators face high rates of burnout characterised by emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation, driven by rigorous schedules, lack of resources, and the pressure to manage behavioural problems. In many systems, teacher pay has not kept pace with the demands being placed on the profession, making recruitment and retention increasingly difficult.

Teachers also face the dilemma of grade inflation -- often pressured to award higher grades to placate students and avoid retaliation in evaluations. This undermines academic standards and places teachers in an impossible position: uphold rigour and face complaints, or lower the bar and maintain peace. The result is a profession caught between what education should be and what institutional incentives force it to become.

In Europe, universities must invest in staff development for digital and hybrid teaching, but many lack robust, publicly funded bodies to support pedagogy and staff competences at scale (Eurydice 2024). Teachers are expected to master new tools, adapt to hybrid formats, and integrate AI into their practice, while their workload increases and their autonomy shrinks. Universities must upgrade legacy systems and ensure interoperability across borders, all while avoiding the increased workload and burnout that these transitions often cause (EUA 2024a).

### Educational institutions and administrators

Traditional universities face an existential question. For generations, the university business model relied on bundling three products: access to knowledge, access to talent networks, and access to a credential trusted by the market. That model thrived when knowledge was scarce, slow, and expensive. Today, all three components are being unbundled by technology, competition, and changing expectations.

Institutions that rely heavily on domestic, full-time, residential undergraduates are particularly exposed to demographic and market changes (Goedmo 2025). In several regions -- the United States, parts of Europe, East Asia -- fewer traditional college-aged students and more competition from online providers and bootcamps are driving enrolment decline (Hanover Research 2025). Retention is also challenged by students' financial stress, mental health issues, and disengagement, which increases dropout risk (SeatsOne 2025).

In Europe specifically, public universities still rely heavily on state funding, but stagnant or shrinking budgets and more competitive allocation schemes force them to seek private income, third-party projects, and higher fees for non-EU students (EHEA 2024). Private universities are expanding enrolment, especially at master's level, but depend more on tuition, philanthropy, and corporate partnerships, which increases their exposure to market downturns and raises concerns about equity and mission drift (OECD 2025b). Both sectors face rising costs for research, digital infrastructure, and student services while trying to keep tuition politically and socially acceptable (EHEA 2024).

Administrators are caught in the middle. Some are incentivised to manipulate statistics to maintain funding rather than focusing on actual education. Others are trying to innovate but are blocked by rigid regulatory environments, accreditation rules, and complex internal governance structures that slow experimentation with new models -- micro-credentials, stackable degrees, work-integrated learning (ASU and UDI 2024).

Institutions also struggle to modernise legacy systems, integrate learning platforms, and deliver flexible, hybrid, or online learning at scale without fragmenting the student experience (Full Fabric 2024). Rapid adoption of AI and analytics brings opportunities for personalisation and efficiency but raises ethical concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, academic integrity, and potential displacement of some academic or administrative roles. Cybersecurity threats and privacy breaches are now routine risks, pushing universities to invest heavily in protection and compliance (KPMG 2020).

We argue that the institutions that survive will need to become something different: not content-delivery machines, but high-trust environments for deep work, identity formation, and character development. They can no longer justify their existence by controlling access to knowledge. Instead, they will need to offer something AI cannot: the crucible of real problems, real stakes, and real human relationships that forge judgment and resilience. If this analysis is correct, the ones that cannot make this transition risk becoming irrelevant.

### Employers and corporations

The corporate sector is both a customer of education and an increasingly active participant in it. Employers need people who can think, produce value, and finish hard things. For decades, the degree served as a convenient proxy for these qualities. That proxy is weakening.

Companies report persistent gaps between what graduates know and what the workplace demands. This is especially true for digital and STEM skills, but also for transversal capabilities -- communication, teamwork, adaptability -- that traditional curricula struggle to teach at all, let alone quickly enough to match the pace of change.

The result is that employers are building their own learning systems: AI-driven training platforms, employer-sponsored tuition programmes, internal skill-tracking tools, and recommendation engines that suggest learning paths tailored to each employee. Education is being pulled into the workplace, sometimes to the benefit of workers, sometimes to the benefit of employers' bottom lines, and often in ways that blur the line between the two.

At the same time, corporations are stakeholders in educational policy. Testing companies like Pearson are criticised for having significant influence over public education policy to protect their bottom line. Education-technology firms shape what gets taught and how it gets measured. This creates tension between educational goals and commercial interests -- a tension that deserves far more scrutiny than it currently receives.

### Policymakers and government bodies

Governments fund education, regulate it, and set the rules that determine what counts as a legitimate credential. They are also responsible for some of the system's deepest problems.

Policymakers are criticised for politicising education and for failing to give teachers a meaningful seat at the table regarding curriculum and standards. The decisions about what students learn and how they are assessed are often made far from the classroom, by people whose incentives are shaped by electoral cycles rather than educational outcomes.

State-mandated standardised testing is a persistent point of contention, with critics arguing that these mandates measure narrow abilities rather than genuine cognitive growth. Yet without some form of standardised measurement, it is difficult to diagnose problems or hold systems accountable. The tension between accountability and meaningful assessment is one of the oldest in education, and it remains unresolved.

To address crises like global learning poverty, high-level national political commitment is required to prioritise foundational skills and implement recovery plans. International organisations advocate for evidence-based strategies, such as the RAPID framework developed by the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF. But political will is unevenly distributed, and short-term pressures often crowd out long-term investment in education.

In Europe, several systems report growing political interference, including contested programme areas (such as gender studies), constraints on institutional autonomy, and new "research security" regimes that tighten external collaboration and data control (University World News 2025). Governments increasingly tie funding to performance contracts and strategic priorities, which can undermine institutional autonomy and long-term basic research capacity if not carefully designed (EUA 2024b). In some countries, austerity measures and policy volatility undermine universities' ability to plan strategically at all (EUA 2024b).

### Families and communities

Parents and families are essential stakeholders, but their ability to support education varies enormously depending on socio-economic circumstances.

In the context of learning recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, successful acceleration of learning requires what researchers have called a "national coalition" that includes families engaged in helping their children learn. But the digital divide and lack of connectivity mean that poorer households are least able to provide this support, and their children's learning losses are the hardest to recover.

Families also face a cultural shift that can be deeply disorienting. For generations, the path was clear: get into the best school you can, get the degree, get the job. That script gave parents a role they understood. Today, they are being asked to evaluate a bewildering landscape of alternatives -- online programmes, bootcamps, micro-credentials, apprenticeships, campus-free institutions -- without clear information about which ones are worth the investment, which ones are legitimate, and which ones are simply good marketing.

The question is shifting from "What school do you go to?" to "What are you building?" -- but most families do not yet have the framework to answer it. This is not a failure of individual parents. It is a failure of the system to provide transparent, trustworthy information about pathways that genuinely lead to good outcomes.

### International organisations

On a global scale, organisations such as the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF work to address learning poverty and the loss of human capital. They advocate for evidence-based strategies, such as the RAPID framework, to recover learning losses and ensure that all children acquire foundational literacy. Their role is to set norms, gather data, and push governments to act -- but they have limited power to enforce anything.

These organisations matter because education is not just a national concern. The skills gaps, equity failures, and credential crises described in this chapter play out across borders. Students move between countries. Employers hire globally. Credentials are evaluated (or not) across systems with different standards and assumptions.

European university alliances are trying to create new forms of cross-border cooperation and blended mobility, but they must navigate tighter visa rules, geopolitical tensions, and research-security scrutiny of partnerships with certain countries (Verfassungsblog 2024). Competition for international students is intensifying, with fee-paying non-EU students becoming central to many institutions' business models, especially in the Netherlands, the Nordics, France, Italy, and Spain (EUF 2024).

Shifting geopolitics within the European Higher Education Area also challenge the coherence of Bologna norms, particularly around academic values, mobility, and mutual recognition (Taylor and Francis 2024a). The international architecture of education -- built over decades through agreements like the Bologna Process -- is under strain from the same forces that are disrupting national systems.

## The European dimension

Many of the problems described in this chapter are global, but Europe faces its own particular version of them, shaped by its distinctive mix of public funding, political diversity, and cross-border ambition.

European public universities operate within a tension that has no easy resolution. They are committed, in principle, to universal access and low or zero tuition for domestic and EU students. But stagnant public budgets, rising costs for research, digital infrastructure, and student services make this commitment increasingly difficult to sustain (EHEA 2024). Both public and private institutions face questions about the quality and recognition of online, blended, and micro-credential offerings within Bologna structures and national quality-assurance regimes (Eurydice 2024).

Europe's ageing populations and regional disparities create a demographic puzzle. Some systems struggle with declining local cohorts while others manage massification and capacity constraints, often within tight public spending envelopes (OECD 2025c). Fee regimes that charge higher tuition to non-EU students have become an important revenue source but create tensions between income needs, diversification goals, and equity narratives (OECD 2025b).

Digitalisation is a central reform theme across the continent, but many systems lack the infrastructure, staff training, and interoperability frameworks needed to deliver high-quality hybrid teaching at scale. The EHEA reports that digital transformation is a priority, but many systems lack robust, publicly funded bodies to support pedagogy, staff development, and high-quality hybrid teaching (Eurydice 2024). Universities must upgrade legacy systems, ensure cross-border compatibility for micro-credentials and virtual mobility, and invest in staff competences -- all while avoiding the increased workload and burnout that these transitions often cause (EUA 2024a).

Political pressures add a further layer. Academic freedom is being tested in several European systems, with growing political interference in programme areas, constraints on institutional autonomy, and new research-security regimes (University World News 2025). The relationship between universities, governments, and society is being renegotiated in real time, and the outcome is far from certain.

The overall picture is one of a system that has expanded access and raised attainment dramatically over the past generation, but that now faces structural pressures -- financial, demographic, political, technological -- that its existing governance models struggle to absorb. Global demand for higher education is projected to rise significantly by 2030 (OECD 2025a), even as many European institutions are already stretched thin. Underfunded institutions and entrenched bureaucracies make large-scale redesign hard, even when everyone agrees it is necessary (OECD 2025a).

## The governance trap

One theme deserves special emphasis because it runs through every problem described above: institutional inertia.

Many universities face a fundamental misalignment between long-established academic structures and the need for agile, cross-sector collaboration with industry, government, and alternative providers (Goedmo 2025). Rigid regulatory environments, accreditation rules, and complex internal governance structures can slow experimentation with new models to a crawl (ASU and UDI 2024).

This is not because the people inside these institutions are complacent or unimaginative. Many of them see the problems clearly and want to act. But universities are designed for stability, not speed. Their governance structures -- shared authority between faculty, administrators, boards, accreditors, and government regulators -- make rapid change extraordinarily difficult. A curriculum update that the labour market demands in months can take years to navigate through committee structures.

The governance trap is one reason why so much educational innovation is happening outside traditional institutions -- in startups, corporate learning departments, and alternative credentialing systems. Whether that is a good thing or a dangerous one is a question this book takes seriously. Innovation that bypasses established quality controls can expand opportunity, but it can also create a Wild West of unregulated credentials, predatory programmes, and systems that benefit the already-privileged while leaving everyone else more confused than before.

## Evidence vs Conjecture: AI Learning Inequality

**The claim:**
As AI-powered learning tools become more available, a new kind of inequality may be emerging based not on access to tools, but on the agency and discipline to use them effectively as thought partners rather than avenues for passive consumption.

**What supports it:**

- The disparity in digital skill gaps by socio-economic status is well-documented (Tier 2: research on digital divides and learning outcomes, OECD 2025a).
- The observation that effective learning with AI tools requires self-direction and iterative practice is grounded in adult learning research and cognitive science.
- The "use as thought partner vs. passive entertainment" distinction is a hypothesis about future behaviour and differential adoption, not yet observed at scale across populations.

**What would change it:**

- If longitudinal studies of AI tool adoption showed that students across socio-economic backgrounds develop similar patterns of use and engagement, this claim would need revision.
- If evidence demonstrates that AI systems effectively scaffold learning for lower-agency users (through better design, guardrails, or adaptive feedback), the inequality risk would diminish.
- If policy or institutional interventions successfully normalize deliberate, high-engagement use across populations, this trajectory could be interrupted.

**Confidence level:**

The foundational concern about self-direction and equity is well-grounded in existing research on learning disparities. The specific hypothesis about AI-powered inequality as distinct from traditional access inequality is plausible but not yet empirically established at scale. This is a pattern to monitor rather than a settled fact.

## What comes next

This book follows the problem through three domains where education meets reality. Part I examines higher education: the traditional university model, the forces unbundling it, and the new institutions and formats -- competency-based programmes, campus-free models, peer-driven coding schools, European university alliances, micro-credentials -- that are trying to replace or reinvent it. We also take a hard look at the pitfalls: credential inflation, algorithmic bias, stratification between elite and non-elite institutions, and the risk that exciting experiments mainly benefit already-privileged learners. Part II moves into the workplace, where employers are building their own learning systems, sponsoring tuition, and using AI to track and develop skills, raising new questions about who controls what workers learn and how their data is used. Part III looks at hiring and recruiting, where AI tools scan CVs, analyse portfolios, run simulations, and even attempt to read emotions in interviews, and where the shift toward skills-based hiring is uneven, messy, and far from complete. Across all three parts, one question keeps returning: who benefits, who is excluded, and who decides.
