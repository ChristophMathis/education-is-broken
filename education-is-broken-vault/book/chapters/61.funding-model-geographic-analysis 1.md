# Funding Models by Countries

European universities are predominantly financed by public funds (local authority taxes), supplemented by tuition fees (especially in the UK and for some master's programs), third-party funding for research (e.g., research councils, EU, industry), and other own-source revenue (continuing education, services, foundations). [europa+1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/SEPDF/cache/1154.pdf)

## Main sources of funding

- Basic public funding: core budgets of universities from national, regional, and local budgets; in Europe usually >70% of university income, in many countries >80%.[eua+1](https://www.eua.eu/images/publications/funding_models_v2.pdf)
- Private households: tuition fees, administrative fees, accommodation and canteen services; Proportion varies greatly between countries (very low in the Nordics, very high in England and the US).[oecd+1](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1a3543e2-en/united-states_784df67f-en.html)
- Companies and non-profit organizations: research contracts, endowed professorships, collaborations, donations; in Europe, usually <30% of total university income.[[eua](https://www.eua.eu/images/publications/funding_models_v2.pdf)]​
- Financial aid for students: Public expenditure goes partly directly to students (scholarships, loans) and partly to universities; a high proportion of tertiary education expenditure, particularly in the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Ireland.[europa+1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Educational_expenditure_statistics)
## Germany
- According to the OECD, around 80–90% of expenditure on tertiary education institutions in Germany comes from public sources (federal, state, and local governments), with private sources (households and businesses) accounting for around 10–20%. [gpseducation.oecd+1](https://gpseducation.oecd.org/Content/EAGCountryNotes/EAG2023_CN_DEU_pdf.pdf)
- In the non-tertiary sector, the private share is around 11%, while in the tertiary sector it is slightly higher due to fees charged by non-governmental providers and third-party funding. [[gpseducation.oecd](https://gpseducation.oecd.org/Content/EAGCountryNotes/EAG2023_CN_DEU_pdf.pdf)]​
- Third-party funding (e.g., DFG, EU, industry) is important within university budgets: in 2022, German universities received approximately €27 billion in basic funding and €10.4 billion in third-party funding (third-party funding ratio well over a quarter of total income).

## France
- In France, approximately 69% of tertiary education expenditure (before transfers) comes from public sources; the remainder comes from private households and other private sources. [[oecd](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1a3543e2-en/france_4d428477-en.html)]​
- France is thus one of the more publicly funded systems, but is slightly below the OECD average for public funding. [oecd+1](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2023_e13bef63-en.html)

## United Kingdom (especially England)

- The UK, especially England, is an example of high tuition fees with comprehensive loan systems: the private share of higher education funding (especially fees) is well above the OECD average and among the highest in Europe. [oecd+1](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1c0d9c79-en/full-report/how-is-tertiary-education-financed_2845d742.html)
- Public funds are mainly allocated to research funding and targeted teaching/student support; basic funding for teaching is largely covered by (loan-financed) fees.

(Exact percentages vary depending on the data set and year; the OECD identifies England as a “high tuition–high aid” model with predominantly private cost sharing by students.)

## USA
- In the USA, only about 39% of tertiary education expenditure comes from public sources, with the rest coming from private sources (households, donations, companies, fees); the public share is thus well below the OECD average. [oecd+1](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1a3543e2-en/united-states_784df67f-en.html)
- Tuition fees play a central role: at public universities, fees account for an average of around 20-30% of income, at private non-profit universities significantly more, and at private for-profit providers, over 90% of income comes from fees.

## Europe as a whole – pattern

- Eurostat and Eurydice show that, in the EU, education is overwhelmingly publicly funded; private sources (including households) play a greater role in tertiary education, but remain below 30% of total expenditure in many countries.[europa+1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/SEPDF/cache/1154.pdf)
- Models range from “low fee–high public” (Nordic countries, Germany, France) to mixed models to “high fee–high aid” (England) and systems dominated by the private sector (USA).[eua+2](https://www.eua.eu/images/publications/funding_models_v2.pdf)
