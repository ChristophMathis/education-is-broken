# How Systems Actually Change (and Why It's Slow)

It is tempting, after surveying the brokenness of higher education and the power of AI, to leap straight to solutions. New models exist. Some of them work. So why isn't everything already different?

Because education systems are not software. You cannot push an update and watch millions of users migrate overnight. Higher education is shaped by overlapping actors with conflicting incentives, protected by regulations written for a different era, and held in place by cultures that reward continuity over experimentation. Understanding who these actors are, what they want, and what constrains them is essential before any discussion of innovation can be taken seriously.

This chapter maps the playing field. It identifies the main actors who shape whether and how higher education changes, explains why good ideas spread unevenly, and offers a realistic check on where the most-discussed innovations actually stand today. It closes with a simple framework for thinking about what comes next.

## Who Decides? The Key Actors and What Drives Them

### Governments and Policymakers

Governments hold the most powerful levers: public funding, regulation, accreditation standards, and student financial aid rules. In most European countries, public universities still rely heavily on state budgets, and even in the United States, federal financial aid eligibility determines which institutions can survive. When governments tie funding to performance contracts and strategic priorities, they can accelerate change, but they can also undermine institutional autonomy and long-term research capacity if the formulas are poorly designed.

The catch is political risk. Education reform affects millions of voters, parents, and workers. Politicians who push too fast risk backlash from faculty unions, alumni networks, and communities that depend on local campuses for economic stability. Politicians who do nothing risk being blamed when graduates cannot find jobs or when tuition keeps rising. The result is a pattern familiar across democracies: bold language in policy documents, cautious incrementalism in practice.

Funding formulas deserve special attention. When governments allocate money based on enrollment headcounts and degree completions, they implicitly reward the traditional model: students in, degrees out. Shifting to performance-based or outcomes-based formulas can encourage innovation, but it can also punish institutions that serve harder-to-reach populations with lower completion rates. Several European systems have introduced performance contracts linking a portion of funding to strategic goals, but the share of funding at stake is often modest enough that institutional behavior changes only at the margins.

### Accreditation Bodies: Gatekeepers or Blockers?

Accreditation agencies exist to protect students and the public from low-quality education. They set standards for faculty qualifications, curriculum design, assessment rigor, and institutional governance. Without accreditation, an institution's degrees carry no recognized value, and its students cannot access government financial aid.

The problem is that many accreditation standards were built around a traditional model: credit hours, seat-time, full-time faculty with terminal degrees, physical campuses. When an institution like Western Governors University designs a competency-based program where students advance by demonstrating mastery rather than completing fixed terms, it collides with these legacy frameworks. WGU's 2017 federal audit is the most vivid example. The Office of the Inspector General argued that WGU's self-paced, mentor-supported model constituted "correspondence education" rather than distance education and recommended the university repay $713 million in federal financial aid. The Department of Education ultimately rejected the most extreme findings, but the audit created years of perception risk: prospective students questioned degree value, and other institutions considering CBE models took note of the regulatory hazard.

Accreditation reform is happening, but slowly. Some agencies are developing competency-based standards, and the European approach to quality assurance for micro-credentials emphasizes that providers should have robust internal mechanisms rather than requiring each individual credential to be evaluated. But reform timelines are measured in years, not months, and the agencies themselves face capacity constraints: small staffs, limited technical expertise in emerging models, and boards composed largely of leaders from traditional institutions.

### University Leaders and Faculty

University presidents and provosts often understand the case for change. Many have read the same reports about demographic decline, employer frustration, and technological disruption. But they operate within governance structures that distribute power widely. In most universities, faculty senates control curriculum, hiring, and academic standards. Departments guard their budgets and course enrollments. Tenure protects individual faculty from institutional pressure to change but also reduces the institution's ability to redeploy resources quickly.

Faculty culture matters as much as formal governance. Academics are trained to be skeptical, to evaluate evidence carefully, and to resist trends that lack rigorous support. These are virtues in research. In institutional decision-making, they can produce a default toward the status quo. When a new teaching model requires faculty to shift from lecturing to coaching, to learn new technologies, to redesign assessments, and to accept that their role may evolve, the response is often cautious. Many instructors lack training in AI tools and digital pedagogy, and professional development is chronically underfunded.

Unions add another layer. In systems with strong faculty unions, changes to workload, class size, online delivery, and assessment methods are subject to collective bargaining. This is not inherently bad; unions protect working conditions and academic freedom. But it does mean that reforms requiring changes to faculty roles face negotiation timelines that can extend for years.

### Employers: Loud Demands, Quiet Inertia

Employers consistently report skills gaps. Surveys find persistent mismatches in digital competencies, communication, teamwork, and adaptability. Many companies have publicly announced moves toward skills-based hiring, dropping degree requirements for some positions, and investing in workforce upskilling through platforms like Guild Education.

Yet employer behavior often lags employer rhetoric. Hiring managers still rely heavily on degrees as screening filters, particularly for roles that carry regulatory requirements (healthcare, law, engineering, finance) or reputational stakes. A 2024 survey found that 60% of hiring managers consider alternatives to traditional degrees, but "consider" and "consistently hire based on" are different things. When a company receives hundreds of applications, the degree checkbox remains a fast, cheap filter, even if it is an imperfect one.

Employers also send mixed signals about micro-credentials. While 92% report they would hire candidates with GenAI-specific micro-credentials, close to half (46%) say they cannot assess program quality when a candidate presents a non-degree credential. The demand signal is noisy: employers want specific skills but lack the frameworks to evaluate alternative ways of certifying them.

### EdTech Firms and Platforms

The educational technology market has grown rapidly, fueled by venture capital, pandemic-era acceleration, and genuine unmet needs. Platforms offering adaptive learning, AI tutoring, micro-credential delivery, and learning management systems have become essential infrastructure for many institutions.

But the incentive structure of venture-backed EdTech deserves scrutiny. Investors seek rapid growth, market capture, and returns on timelines (5-10 years) that do not match the pace of educational change. This creates pressure to scale fast, lock institutions into proprietary ecosystems, and prioritize engagement metrics over learning outcomes. Vendor lock-in is a real risk: once a university builds its curriculum around a particular platform's architecture, switching costs become prohibitive.

Platform economics also tend toward consolidation. The largest providers can invest more in AI, data infrastructure, and content, making it harder for smaller or public alternatives to compete. This raises questions about who controls the learning infrastructure of the future: public institutions accountable to learners and society, or private platforms accountable to shareholders?

### Students: Consumers, Citizens, and Constrained Agents

Students are often described as the primary beneficiaries of educational innovation, and they should be. But their agency is constrained in ways that reformers sometimes overlook. Most students choose from a limited set of options shaped by geography, family resources, information access, and credential requirements set by employers and regulators. A first-generation student in a mid-sized European city does not face the same menu of choices as an upper-middle-class student in a global capital.

Students are also subject to what the existing literature calls the "agency divide." Self-directed, digitally fluent, motivated learners thrive in flexible, technology-rich environments. Students who need more structure, mentorship, and scaffolding can struggle in the same settings. Innovations designed for the first group risk excluding the second, and the second group disproportionately comes from lower-income and marginalized backgrounds.

The consumer framing itself is incomplete. Students are not just purchasing a credential; they are developing as thinkers, citizens, and people. Reducing education to a transaction between a buyer and a provider misses the developmental, social, and civic dimensions that make higher education a public good, not just a private investment.

## Why Good Ideas Spread Unevenly

If a model works, why doesn't everyone adopt it? Because "works" is context-dependent, and the conditions for adoption vary dramatically across countries, institutions, and regulatory regimes.

### Micro-Credentials: Same Idea, Different Speeds

Micro-credentials illustrate the pattern clearly. The European Commission has championed a common European approach to micro-credentials, aligned with Bologna structures (ECTS credits, EQF levels, quality assurance). The ECIU alliance became the first European University Alliance to issue jointly recognized, blockchain-secured digital micro-credentials using the Europass wallet in 2023. The European Commission is advancing a joint European degree label to be rolled out from mid-2026.

Yet adoption varies enormously by country. Some national qualifications frameworks have embedded micro-credentials and linked them to established quality assurance processes. Others treat them as unregulated continuing-education offerings with no formal recognition. Government financial aid rarely covers micro-credentials, creating a 23% barrier to adoption according to the research literature. The result: the same innovation moves at different speeds depending on whether national regulators have cleared the path or left it blocked.

In the United States, the landscape is even more fragmented. Over one million unique educational credentials now exist, a threefold increase since 2018, offered by universities, industry providers, bootcamps, and platforms. Without standardized definitions, learning outcomes, or assessment rigor, micro-credentials vary wildly in value. Employers report confusion: 46% cannot assess program quality when a candidate presents a non-degree credential. The innovation exists, but the ecosystem needed to make it trustworthy and portable does not yet exist at scale.

### The WGU Audit: When Regulation Meets Innovation

Western Governors University serves over 200,000 students with fully online, self-paced, competency-based degree programs. Its model lets learners complete pre-assessments, work through only the material they need, and take final assessments when ready. Some students have completed both a bachelor's and a master's degree in nine months by leveraging prior knowledge.

But the 2017 federal audit exposed a structural tension that affects every CBE program. The OIG argued that WGU's model, which contracts course content from various sources and employs mentors rather than traditional instructors, did not meet the regulatory definition of "distance education" because it lacked sufficient "regular and substantive interaction" between faculty and students. The recommended $713 million repayment would have been existential. The Department of Education rejected the finding, but the message to other institutions was clear: innovate at your own regulatory risk.

This is not an isolated case. Institutions without a substantial core of qualified faculty with full-time responsibility face steep eligibility challenges for accreditation. The debates about whether mentor-based, content-contracted models meet standards for faculty governance of curriculum and academic quality absorb resources and create uncertainty that discourages smaller institutions from attempting similar reforms.

## Adoption Reality Checks

For each of the most-discussed innovations, it is worth asking three simple questions: How big is this actually? Where is it concentrated? What is blocking wider adoption?

### Competency-Based Education (CBE)

- **Current scale:** CBE remains concentrated in a small number of large institutions, primarily in the United States. WGU (200,000+ students) and SNHU are the dominant players. Most traditional universities have not adopted CBE at scale, and many CBE pilots at smaller institutions have quietly ended.

- **Where concentrated:** Overwhelmingly in the US, serving adult and non-traditional learners. European adoption is minimal, partly because Bologna structures already define learning outcomes but retain credit-hour and seat-time norms in practice.

- **Main blockers:**
- Accreditation frameworks built around seat-time and faculty structures that CBE disrupts.
- The measurement trap: defining and assessing competencies at scale is harder than it sounds. A meta-review found that despite CBE approaches emerging in the 1970s, there is very limited evidence for their effectiveness.
- CBE privileges self-directed, digitally literate learners and struggles to serve students who need social scaffolding and structured progression.

### Micro-Credentials

- **Current scale:** Growing rapidly in volume but unevenly in quality and recognition. Over one million unique credentials exist in the US alone. In Europe, the ECIU alliance and several national systems have begun formal integration, but most micro-credentials remain outside national qualifications frameworks.

- **Where concentrated:** Tech-adjacent fields, professional development, and corporate upskilling. University-issued micro-credentials are a small fraction of the total market. Employer recognition remains inconsistent.

- **Main blockers:**
- Employer confusion: nearly half cannot assess the quality of non-degree credentials.
- Fragmentation: stackability promises often fail in execution because institutions lack credit equivalency frameworks and transparent metadata for true portability.
- Financial aid exclusion: government student aid rarely covers micro-credentials, limiting access for lower-income learners.

### AI-First Educational Models

- **Current scale:** No comprehensive AI-first university operates at scale in higher education as of early 2026. The Alpha School example frequently cited in discussions is a K-12 prototype with a small cohort and no longitudinal outcomes data. Individual AI tools (adaptive platforms, predictive analytics, AI tutors) are deployed across many institutions, but none has built an entire institutional model around AI from the ground up.

- **Where concentrated:** Pilot programs at large, well-resourced institutions like Arizona State University and SNHU. Conceptual proposals in academic literature and policy documents.

- **Main blockers:**
- No proven model at scale with demonstrated learning outcomes.
- Faculty unpreparedness: professors often lack training in AI tools, and implementation requires substantial investment in platforms, cybersecurity, and continuous monitoring.
- Regulatory uncertainty: the EU AI Act, which entered into force in stages starting in 2024, classifies AI systems used in education as "high-risk," requiring conformity assessments, transparency obligations, and human oversight. Compliance costs and legal uncertainty slow institutional adoption.
- Algorithmic bias: 80% of AI systems in education showed some form of bias when not properly audited, raising equity concerns that regulators and institutions have not fully resolved.

### European Universities Alliances

##### Current scale
- Over 60 alliances now exist under the European Universities Initiative, launched in 2017. These involve hundreds of institutions across Europe and represent significant public investment through Erasmus+ and Horizon Europe funding.

##### Where concentrated
Predominantly Western European, research-intensive universities. Over 75% of EUI member institutions rank among the top 500 globally. Institutions in Central and Eastern Europe, smaller universities, and applied-sciences institutions are disproportionately underrepresented.

##### Main blockers
- The Matthew effect: alliances built on pre-existing partnerships and elite status consolidate advantages for already-privileged institutions, deepening vertical stratification rather than spreading innovation broadly.
- Resource asymmetries: smaller institutions face higher relative costs to participate (staff time, travel, co-funding) while receiving proportionally smaller benefits.
- Regulatory heterogeneity: cross-border recognition of joint degrees and micro-credentials requires aligning diverse national frameworks, quality assurance regimes, and legal structures, a process that moves at the speed of the slowest participant.

## A Scenario Matrix: What Shapes the Next Decade

Rather than predicting a single future, it is more honest and more useful to map the space of plausible outcomes. Two axes capture the forces that matter most:

- **Regulatory openness:** How willing are governments and accreditation bodies to adapt rules for new models? At one extreme, regulators actively create space for competency-based credentials, AI-integrated pedagogy, and cross-border recognition. At the other, existing rules remain unchanged, and innovators must fit new models into old frameworks or operate outside the recognized system.

- **Institutional capacity:** How able are universities to invest in transformation? This includes financial resources, technical infrastructure, faculty development, and organizational agility. At one extreme, institutions have the funding, talent, and governance flexibility to redesign programs. At the other, they are constrained by budget cuts, legacy systems, and internal resistance.

These two axes produce four quadrants:

### Quadrant 1: Open Rules, Strong Capacity (Accelerated Transformation)
Regulators clear the path. Well-resourced institutions invest in CBE, AI integration, micro-credential ecosystems, and cross-border alliances. Innovation spreads relatively quickly, though concentration at elite institutions risks deepening stratification. This is the scenario most innovation advocates imagine.

### Quadrant 2: Open Rules, Weak Capacity (Uneven Disruption)
Rules allow experimentation, but most institutions lack the money, talent, or organizational flexibility to take advantage. A few large, well-funded players (and EdTech platforms) capture the opportunity. Smaller and public institutions fall further behind. The gap between innovative and traditional institutions widens.

### Quadrant 3: Closed Rules, Strong Capacity (Frustrated Innovation)
Institutions have the resources and will to change but are blocked by rigid accreditation standards, funding formulas tied to seat-time, and regulatory uncertainty (e.g., EU AI Act compliance costs). Innovation happens at the margins: internal pilots, continuing education, corporate partnerships that sit outside the regulated degree system. Change is slow and incremental.

### Quadrant 4: Closed Rules, Weak Capacity (Institutional Stagnation)
Neither the regulatory environment nor institutional resources support transformation. Universities continue operating with legacy models, facing declining enrollment, employer frustration, and fiscal stress. Change comes, if at all, through crisis: closures, mergers, or external disruption by platforms and employers who build parallel credentialing systems outside traditional higher education.

## What This Means

No country or institution sits neatly in one quadrant. Most occupy messy positions between them, with some programs innovating while others remain unchanged, some regulators experimenting while others hold firm. The point of the matrix is not to predict but to clarify the variables that matter.

Two conclusions follow. First, innovation alone is not enough. Without regulatory adaptation, even the best new models remain marginal or legally precarious. Without institutional capacity, even the most permissive rules produce nothing. Both levers must move.

Second, the pace and direction of change are choices, not inevitabilities. Governments can redesign funding formulas and accreditation standards. Universities can invest in faculty development and organizational agility. Employers can build credible frameworks for evaluating alternative credentials. Students can demand transparency and quality. None of these things will happen automatically. All of them require actors to accept short-term costs and political risks for long-term gains.

The chapters that follow examine the most promising innovations in detail, their real evidence base, their pitfalls, and the design choices that determine whether they expand opportunity or deepen inequality. But every one of those innovations operates within the system described here. Understanding the system is the first step toward changing it.
