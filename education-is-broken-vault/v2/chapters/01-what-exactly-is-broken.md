# What Exactly Is Broken?

Everyone seems to agree that education is broken. Politicians say it. Employers say it. Students
feel it. Parents worry about it. But when you press people to explain what "broken" actually means,
the answers scatter in every direction. Some point to cost. Others point to irrelevance. Others
still talk about fairness, or mental health, or the fact that a four-year degree no longer guarantees
anything it once promised.

If you are picking up this book, you have probably felt it already: something about education no
longer fits the world we live in. A degree costs more than a car, new skills go out of date in a few
years, and many students and workers feel anxious, burnt out, or simply lost.

At the same time, extraordinary new possibilities have appeared. A teenager in a small town can
learn advanced math from an AI tutor at midnight. A nurse can take an online micro-course and
qualify for new responsibilities at work. A 40-year-old programmer can retrain for a new role using
employer-funded learning, guided by recommendation systems that feel closer to Netflix than to
school.

So is education broken -- or is it being rebuilt? The honest answer is: both. The old structures are
under strain, but the new ones are uneven, confusing, and sometimes unfair.

This chapter tries to pin the problem down. Before we can talk about solutions -- and this book is
full of them, some promising, some dangerous, some both -- we need a shared understanding of what is
actually failing, for whom, and why.

## Four dimensions of brokenness

When we say education is broken, we are really talking about four things at once. Each one matters
on its own, but together they form a system that is failing on multiple fronts simultaneously.


### 1. Learning outcomes

The most basic question is: are people actually learning? The evidence is not reassuring.

Globally, the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF have documented what they call "learning poverty" --
children and young people who attend school but cannot read, write, or do basic math at the level
expected for their age. This is not a problem confined to the developing world. In wealthy
countries, standardised assessments consistently show stagnant or declining performance in
foundational skills, even as spending per student has risen.

In higher education, the picture is more nuanced but still troubling. Students increasingly view
themselves as consumers who feel entitled to high grades by virtue of paying tuition -- a mindset
that research has linked to lower academic performance and weaker critical thinking skills. Grade
inflation, where institutions award higher marks without corresponding improvements in learning, has
become widespread. Teachers feel pressured to inflate grades to avoid negative student evaluations,
and administrators are sometimes incentivised to manipulate statistics to maintain funding rather
than to improve actual education.

Meanwhile, standardised testing -- the main tool governments use to measure learning at scale -- is
itself contested. Critics argue that state-mandated assessments measure narrow abilities rather than
genuine cognitive growth. If the tests are flawed, the data they produce is flawed, and the policies
built on that data are built on sand.

The result is a system that produces credentials without reliably producing competence. A degree says
you finished something. It does not always say you learned something.


### 2. Equity

Education is supposed to be the great equaliser. In practice, it often reinforces the gaps it claims
to close.

Affordability challenges and high debt burdens disproportionately affect lower-income and
marginalised students, undermining equity and social mobility goals
([OECD, Education at a Glance 2025](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1c0d9c79-en.html)).
In Europe, rapid expansion of tertiary attainment has improved overall participation rates, but
persistent inequalities by socio-economic status, migrant background, and region continue to
challenge the promise of fair access in both public and private institutions
([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1c0d9c79-en/full-report/how-is-tertiary-education-financed_2845d742.html)).

The digital divide adds another layer. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, poorer households
with limited connectivity saw their children fall further behind. The loss was not temporary. Without
intervention, those gaps compound over time, narrowing future opportunities for the students who
could least afford to lose ground.

Neurodivergent learners remain underserved by mainstream systems that demand conformity rather than
providing specialised support. These students often need environments that allow for what
researchers call "unmasking" -- the ability to learn in ways that match how their minds actually
work, rather than forcing adaptation to a system designed for a narrow definition of normal.

And as AI-powered learning tools become more available, a new kind of inequality may be emerging -- not
based on access to information, but on the agency and discipline to use it. When learning is
abundant, the advantage is likely to go to those with the self-direction to build and iterate, rather than to
be passively entertained or overwhelmed. If this pattern holds, the divide will fall between those who use these tools as
thought partners and those who use them to avoid thinking altogether.


### 3. Cost

A degree now costs more than a car in many countries. In the United States, student debt has become
a defining feature of an entire generation's economic life. In Europe, while tuition for domestic
students is often lower or even free at public universities, the real costs are still rising: living
expenses, opportunity costs, and the growing reliance on fees charged to non-EU students to balance
institutional budgets
([EHEA, 2024](https://ehea.info/Immagini/the-european-higher-education-area-in-2024-EC0224018ENN.pdf)).

Behind the scenes, institutions face their own financial crisis. Shrinking public funding, rising
operating costs, and dependence on tuition make financial sustainability a central risk, especially
for small and mid-tier institutions
([Goedmo](https://goedmo.com/blog/problems-in-higher-education/)). Growing costs for healthcare,
mental health services, compliance, and infrastructure -- labs, housing, digital systems -- outpace
available revenue sources
([Deloitte, 2025 Higher Education Trends](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/2025-us-higher-education-trends.html)).

Many universities respond with tuition hikes, programme cuts, staff reductions, or even closures,
which can further erode access and public confidence
([Changing Higher Ed](https://changinghighered.com/higher-ed-challenges-2025-solution-examples/)).
This creates a vicious cycle: costs rise, public trust falls, enrolment drops, revenues shrink,
and institutions cut further. The small and mid-tier schools caught in this spiral are the ones that
often serve the students who most need affordable education.

The cost problem is not just about price. It is about whether the price is justified by what you get
in return. And for a growing number of students and families, the answer is no longer obvious.


### 4. Labour-market fit

Students and families increasingly question the return on investment of a degree, given high
tuition, student debt, and uncertain job outcomes
([KPMG](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2020/10/future-of-higher-education.pdf)).
And their scepticism is grounded in reality.

Employers report persistent skills gaps, especially in digital, STEM, and transversal skills --
communication, teamwork, adaptability -- that curricula often fail to deliver quickly enough
([OECD, Education at a Glance 2025](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1c0d9c79-en.html)).
Slow academic governance can delay curriculum updates, making programmes feel outdated compared to
fast-moving labour-market demands and alternative credentials
([ASU/UDI](https://udi.asu.edu/co-lab/article/Not-If-But-How-Redesigning-the-Future-of-Higher-Education)).

The half-life of a skill is shrinking. A four-year fixed curriculum is structurally outdated before
a student even finishes it. What was cutting-edge when a student enrolled may be standard practice
-- or obsolete -- by the time they graduate. This is especially true in technology-adjacent fields,
but it increasingly applies across the board. Healthcare protocols change. Regulatory frameworks
evolve. Business models shift. The pace of change has outrun the pace of curriculum development.

Meanwhile, companies are shifting their valuation of education. They increasingly look for
demonstrated capability -- portfolios, projects, and evidence of value creation -- rather than
relying solely on degrees as proxies for competence. Companies do not hire degrees; they hire the
signal that a candidate can think, produce value, and finish hard things. Because AI is making it cheaper
to verify skills through projects, simulations, and portfolios, the degree appears to be shifting from a gate
to a preference -- though the pace and extent of this shift remain uncertain.

The question is moving from "What school did you go to?" to "What can you actually do?" That is a
profound shift, and the educational system has not caught up with it.

## Where this book focuses -- and where it does not

This book is primarily about two domains: higher education and corporate learning. These are the
places where the brokenness is most visible, where the most money is at stake, and where the most
dramatic experiments in reform are underway. We also spend significant time on recruiting and hiring,
because that is where education meets the labour market and where credentials are tested against
real jobs.

We are not writing a book about primary and secondary schooling, though K-12 problems are deeply
relevant. Many of the failures in higher education -- remedial classes, disengaged students, shallow
preparation -- trace back to what happened (or did not happen) in earlier years. The global crisis
of learning poverty, documented by the World Bank and its partners, is fundamentally a K-12 problem
that casts a long shadow over everything that follows. We will reference it where it matters, but a
thorough treatment of school systems would require a different book.

Similarly, while we discuss AI and technology throughout, this is not a technology book. It is a book
about people and institutions trying to adapt to a world that is changing faster than their
structures allow.


---


## Who feels the brokenness: seven groups, seven experiences

The problems we have described do not land equally on everyone. Education involves at least seven
distinct groups of stakeholders, and each one experiences the system's failures differently.
Understanding these different perspectives is essential, because a reform that helps one group can
easily harm another.


### Students

Students are at the centre of the system, but they are often the least powerful actors within it.
They are currently processed in batches -- taught at a speed that bores top performers and leaves
struggling learners behind -- and assessed through static grades that provide a snapshot of
performance rather than a picture of growth.

In higher education, students face a painful bind. They pay more than ever for degrees whose
labour-market value is increasingly uncertain. Many experience financial stress, mental health
difficulties, and disengagement, all of which increase dropout risk
([SeatsOne, 2025](https://seatsone.ai/the-ultimate-guide-for-universities-in-2025-addressing-higher-educations-challenges/)).

Specific populations are hit harder. Neurodivergent learners are critical stakeholders often
underserved by mandatory integration in mainstream schools, requiring environments that allow for
specialised support rather than forced adaptation. First-generation students, students from
low-income families, and students with migrant backgrounds face compounding barriers that the
system was never designed to address.

The consumer mindset -- "I paid for this, so I deserve a good grade" -- is itself a symptom of
brokenness. When students see education primarily as a transaction, something has already gone
wrong with the value proposition. But it is hard to blame them. When a degree costs what a house
deposit used to cost, treating it as a product is a rational response to an irrational system.


### Teachers and educators

Teachers are asked to do more with less, and the strain is showing. The role is shifting from being
a broadcaster of information to being a designer of learning experiences, acting as mentors,
coaches, and guardians of standards. This is a more demanding job, not a less demanding one.

Yet educators face high rates of burnout characterised by emotional exhaustion and
depersonalisation, driven by rigorous schedules, lack of resources, and the pressure to manage
behavioural problems. In many systems, teacher pay has not kept pace with the demands being placed
on the profession, making recruitment and retention increasingly difficult.

Teachers also face the dilemma of grade inflation -- often pressured to award higher grades to
placate students and avoid retaliation in evaluations. This undermines academic standards and
places teachers in an impossible position: uphold rigour and face complaints, or lower the bar and
maintain peace. The result is a profession caught between what education should be and what
institutional incentives force it to become.

In Europe, universities must invest in staff development for digital and hybrid teaching, but many
lack robust, publicly funded bodies to support pedagogy and staff competences at scale
([Eurydice/EHEA](https://eurydice.eacea.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-05/Chapter_5_Learning_and_teaching.pdf)).
Teachers are expected to master new tools, adapt to hybrid formats, and integrate AI into their
practice, while their workload increases and their autonomy shrinks. Universities must upgrade
legacy systems and ensure interoperability across borders, all while avoiding the increased
workload and burnout that these transitions often cause
([EUA, Trends 2024](https://www.eua.eu/publications/reports/trends-2024.html)).


### Educational institutions and administrators

Traditional universities face an existential question. For generations, the university business
model relied on bundling three products: access to knowledge, access to talent networks, and access
to a credential trusted by the market. That model thrived when knowledge was scarce, slow, and
expensive. Today, all three components are being unbundled by technology, competition, and changing
expectations.

Institutions that rely heavily on domestic, full-time, residential undergraduates are particularly
exposed to demographic and market changes
([Goedmo](https://goedmo.com/blog/problems-in-higher-education/)). In several regions -- the
United States, parts of Europe, East Asia -- fewer traditional college-aged students and more
competition from online providers and bootcamps are driving enrolment decline
([Hanover Research](https://www.hanoverresearch.com/reports-and-briefs/higher-education/5-ways-higher-education-is-changing-in-2025-26/)).
Retention is also challenged by students' financial stress, mental health issues, and
disengagement, which increases dropout risk
([SeatsOne](https://seatsone.ai/the-ultimate-guide-for-universities-in-2025-addressing-higher-educations-challenges/)).

In Europe specifically, public universities still rely heavily on state funding, but stagnant or
shrinking budgets and more competitive allocation schemes force them to seek private income,
third-party projects, and higher fees for non-EU students
([EHEA, 2024](https://ehea.info/Immagini/the-european-higher-education-area-in-2024-EC0224018ENN.pdf)).
Private universities are expanding enrolment, especially at master's level, but depend more on
tuition, philanthropy, and corporate partnerships, which increases their exposure to market
downturns and raises concerns about equity and mission drift
([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1c0d9c79-en/full-report/how-is-tertiary-education-financed_2845d742.html)).
Both sectors face rising costs for research, digital infrastructure, and student services while
trying to keep tuition politically and socially acceptable
([EHEA](https://ehea.info/Immagini/the-european-higher-education-area-in-2024-EC0224018ENN.pdf)).

Administrators are caught in the middle. Some are incentivised to manipulate statistics to maintain
funding rather than focusing on actual education. Others are trying to innovate but are blocked by
rigid regulatory environments, accreditation rules, and complex internal governance structures that
slow experimentation with new models -- micro-credentials, stackable degrees, work-integrated
learning
([ASU/UDI](https://udi.asu.edu/co-lab/article/Not-If-But-How-Redesigning-the-Future-of-Higher-Education)).

Institutions also struggle to modernise legacy systems, integrate learning platforms, and deliver
flexible, hybrid, or online learning at scale without fragmenting the student experience
([Full Fabric](https://www.fullfabric.com/articles/challenges-in-higher-education-management)).
Rapid adoption of AI and analytics brings opportunities for personalisation and efficiency but
raises ethical concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, academic integrity, and potential
displacement of some academic or administrative roles. Cybersecurity threats and privacy breaches
are now routine risks, pushing universities to invest heavily in protection and compliance
([KPMG](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2020/10/future-of-higher-education.pdf)).

We argue that the institutions that survive will need to become something different: not content-delivery
machines, but high-trust environments for deep work, identity formation, and character development.
They can no longer justify their existence by controlling access to knowledge. Instead, they will
need to offer something AI cannot: the crucible of real problems, real stakes, and real human
relationships that forge judgment and resilience. If this analysis is correct, the ones that cannot make this transition risk
becoming irrelevant.


### Employers and corporations

The corporate sector is both a customer of education and an increasingly active participant in it.
Employers need people who can think, produce value, and finish hard things. For decades, the degree
served as a convenient proxy for these qualities. That proxy is weakening.

Companies report persistent gaps between what graduates know and what the workplace demands. This
is especially true for digital and STEM skills, but also for transversal capabilities --
communication, teamwork, adaptability -- that traditional curricula struggle to teach at all,
let alone quickly enough to match the pace of change.

The result is that employers are building their own learning systems: AI-driven training platforms,
employer-sponsored tuition programmes, internal skill-tracking tools, and recommendation engines
that suggest learning paths tailored to each employee. Education is being pulled into the
workplace, sometimes to the benefit of workers, sometimes to the benefit of employers' bottom
lines, and often in ways that blur the line between the two.

At the same time, corporations are stakeholders in educational policy. Testing companies like
Pearson are criticised for having significant influence over public education policy to protect
their bottom line. Education-technology firms shape what gets taught and how it gets measured. This
creates tension between educational goals and commercial interests -- a tension that deserves far
more scrutiny than it currently receives.


### Policymakers and government bodies

Governments fund education, regulate it, and set the rules that determine what counts as a
legitimate credential. They are also responsible for some of the system's deepest problems.

Policymakers are criticised for politicising education and for failing to give teachers a meaningful
seat at the table regarding curriculum and standards. The decisions about what students learn and how
they are assessed are often made far from the classroom, by people whose incentives are shaped by
electoral cycles rather than educational outcomes.

State-mandated standardised testing is a persistent point of contention, with critics arguing that
these mandates measure narrow abilities rather than genuine cognitive growth. Yet without some form
of standardised measurement, it is difficult to diagnose problems or hold systems accountable. The
tension between accountability and meaningful assessment is one of the oldest in education, and it
remains unresolved.

To address crises like global learning poverty, high-level national political commitment is required
to prioritise foundational skills and implement recovery plans. International organisations
advocate for evidence-based strategies, such as the RAPID framework developed by the World Bank,
UNESCO, and UNICEF. But political will is unevenly distributed, and short-term pressures often
crowd out long-term investment in education.

In Europe, several systems report growing political interference, including contested programme
areas (such as gender studies), constraints on institutional autonomy, and new "research security"
regimes that tighten external collaboration and data control
([University World News](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=2025010808011331)).
Governments increasingly tie funding to performance contracts and strategic priorities, which can
undermine institutional autonomy and long-term basic research capacity if not carefully designed
([EUA](https://www.eua.eu/images/designing_strategies_for_efficient_funding_of_universities_in_europe_define.pdf)).
In some countries, austerity measures and policy volatility undermine universities' ability to plan
strategically at all
([EUA](https://www.eua.eu/images/designing_strategies_for_efficient_funding_of_universities_in_europe_define.pdf)).


### Families and communities

Parents and families are essential stakeholders, but their ability to support education varies
enormously depending on socio-economic circumstances.

In the context of learning recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, successful acceleration of
learning requires what researchers have called a "national coalition" that includes families engaged
in helping their children learn. But the digital divide and lack of connectivity mean that poorer
households are least able to provide this support, and their children's learning losses are the
hardest to recover.

Families also face a cultural shift that can be deeply disorienting. For generations, the path was
clear: get into the best school you can, get the degree, get the job. That script gave parents a
role they understood. Today, they are being asked to evaluate a bewildering landscape of
alternatives -- online programmes, bootcamps, micro-credentials, apprenticeships, campus-free
institutions -- without clear information about which ones are worth the investment, which ones are
legitimate, and which ones are simply good marketing.

The question is shifting from "What school do you go to?" to "What are you building?" -- but most
families do not yet have the framework to answer it. This is not a failure of individual parents.
It is a failure of the system to provide transparent, trustworthy information about pathways that
genuinely lead to good outcomes.


### International organisations

On a global scale, organisations such as the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF work to address
learning poverty and the loss of human capital. They advocate for evidence-based strategies, such as
the RAPID framework, to recover learning losses and ensure that all children acquire foundational
literacy. Their role is to set norms, gather data, and push governments to act -- but they have
limited power to enforce anything.

These organisations matter because education is not just a national concern. The skills gaps, equity
failures, and credential crises described in this chapter play out across borders. Students move
between countries. Employers hire globally. Credentials are evaluated (or not) across systems with
different standards and assumptions.

European university alliances are trying to create new forms of cross-border cooperation and
blended mobility, but they must navigate tighter visa rules, geopolitical tensions, and
research-security scrutiny of partnerships with certain countries
([Verfassungsblog](https://verfassungsblog.de/academic-freedom-security/)). Competition for
international students is intensifying, with fee-paying non-EU students becoming central to many
institutions' business models, especially in the Netherlands, the Nordics, France, Italy, and Spain
([University Foundation / EUF](https://uni-foundation.eu/2024/02/08/internationalisation-higher-education-challenges-trends-priorities/)).

Shifting geopolitics within the European Higher Education Area also challenge the coherence of
Bologna norms, particularly around academic values, mobility, and mutual recognition
([Taylor & Francis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21568235.2024.2398742)). The
international architecture of education -- built over decades through agreements like the Bologna
Process -- is under strain from the same forces that are disrupting national systems.

## The European dimension

Many of the problems described in this chapter are global, but Europe faces its own particular
version of them, shaped by its distinctive mix of public funding, political diversity, and
cross-border ambition.

European public universities operate within a tension that has no easy resolution. They are
committed, in principle, to universal access and low or zero tuition for domestic and EU students.
But stagnant public budgets, rising costs for research, digital infrastructure, and student services
make this commitment increasingly difficult to sustain
([EHEA, 2024](https://ehea.info/Immagini/the-european-higher-education-area-in-2024-EC0224018ENN.pdf)).
Both public and private institutions face questions about the quality and recognition of online,
blended, and micro-credential offerings within Bologna structures and national quality-assurance
regimes
([Eurydice/EHEA](https://eurydice.eacea.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-05/Chapter_5_Learning_and_teaching.pdf)).

Europe's ageing populations and regional disparities create a demographic puzzle. Some systems
struggle with declining local cohorts while others manage massification and capacity constraints,
often within tight public spending envelopes
([OECD, Trends Shaping Education 2025](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/trends-shaping-education-2025_ee6587fd-en.html)).
Fee regimes that charge higher tuition to non-EU students have become an important revenue source
but create tensions between income needs, diversification goals, and equity narratives
([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1c0d9c79-en/full-report/how-is-tertiary-education-financed_2845d742.html)).

Digitalisation is a central reform theme across the continent, but many systems lack the
infrastructure, staff training, and interoperability frameworks needed to deliver high-quality
hybrid teaching at scale. The EHEA reports that digital transformation is a priority, but many
systems lack robust, publicly funded bodies to support pedagogy, staff development, and
high-quality hybrid teaching
([Eurydice/EHEA](https://eurydice.eacea.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-05/Chapter_5_Learning_and_teaching.pdf)).
Universities must upgrade legacy systems, ensure cross-border compatibility for micro-credentials
and virtual mobility, and invest in staff competences -- all while avoiding the increased workload
and burnout that these transitions often cause
([EUA, Trends 2024](https://www.eua.eu/publications/reports/trends-2024.html)).

Political pressures add a further layer. Academic freedom is being tested in several European
systems, with growing political interference in programme areas, constraints on institutional
autonomy, and new research-security regimes
([University World News](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=2025010808011331)).
The relationship between universities, governments, and society is being renegotiated in real time,
and the outcome is far from certain.

The overall picture is one of a system that has expanded access and raised attainment dramatically
over the past generation, but that now faces structural pressures -- financial, demographic,
political, technological -- that its existing governance models struggle to absorb. Global demand
for higher education is projected to rise significantly by 2030
([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1c0d9c79-en.html)), even
as many European institutions are already stretched thin. Underfunded institutions and entrenched
bureaucracies make large-scale redesign hard, even when everyone agrees it is necessary
([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1c0d9c79-en.html)).


---


## The governance trap

One theme deserves special emphasis because it runs through every problem described above:
institutional inertia.

Many universities face a fundamental misalignment between long-established academic structures and
the need for agile, cross-sector collaboration with industry, government, and alternative providers
([Goedmo](https://goedmo.com/blog/problems-in-higher-education/)). Rigid regulatory environments,
accreditation rules, and complex internal governance structures can slow experimentation with new
models to a crawl
([ASU/UDI](https://udi.asu.edu/co-lab/article/Not-If-But-How-Redesigning-the-Future-of-Higher-Education)).

This is not because the people inside these institutions are complacent or unimaginative. Many of
them see the problems clearly and want to act. But universities are designed for stability, not
speed. Their governance structures -- shared authority between faculty, administrators, boards,
accreditors, and government regulators -- make rapid change extraordinarily difficult. A curriculum
update that the labour market demands in months can take years to navigate through committee
structures.

The governance trap is one reason why so much educational innovation is happening outside
traditional institutions -- in startups, corporate learning departments, and alternative
credentialing systems. Whether that is a good thing or a dangerous one is a question this book
takes seriously. Innovation that bypasses established quality controls can expand opportunity, but
it can also create a Wild West of unregulated credentials, predatory programmes, and systems that
benefit the already-privileged while leaving everyone else more confused than before.


---


## What comes next

This book follows the problem through three domains where education meets reality. Part I examines
higher education: the traditional university model, the forces unbundling it, and the new
institutions and formats -- competency-based programmes, campus-free models, peer-driven coding
schools, European university alliances, micro-credentials -- that are trying to replace or reinvent
it. We also take a hard look at the pitfalls: credential inflation, algorithmic bias,
stratification between elite and non-elite institutions, and the risk that exciting experiments
mainly benefit already-privileged learners. Part II moves into the workplace, where employers are
building their own learning systems, sponsoring tuition, and using AI to track and develop skills,
raising new questions about who controls what workers learn and how their data is used. Part III
looks at hiring and recruiting, where AI tools scan CVs, analyse portfolios, run simulations, and
even attempt to read emotions in interviews, and where the shift toward skills-based hiring is
uneven, messy, and far from complete. Across all three parts, one question keeps returning: who
benefits, who is excluded, and who decides.
