# Degrees, Skills, and the New Signalling Stack

Earlier in this book we made a bold claim: the degree is shifting from a gate to a preference. Later, when we looked at how employers actually hire, we found a messier picture -- companies that drop degree requirements on paper still struggle to interpret what candidates bring instead. One chapter announces the death of credentials; another shows the funeral has been poorly attended.

Both observations are true. They just operate on different timescales and in different sectors. This chapter reconciles them by asking three questions: Why did degrees become so powerful in the first place? What is genuinely changing? And what should we realistically expect over the next five, ten, and twenty years?

The answer, we argue, is not that degrees disappear. It is that they become one layer in a broader signalling stack -- a multilevel system where degrees, micro-credentials, portfolios, and AI-derived behavioural data each carry different weight depending on the profession, the employer, and the moment in a person's career.

## Why Did Degrees Become So Powerful?

### A Brief History of Signalling

For most of human history, you proved competence by doing the work. A blacksmith apprenticed for years, and the village could see whether the horseshoes held. A merchant's reputation was local and personal. Signalling -- the economist's term for communicating your qualities to strangers who cannot directly observe them -- was not a problem because communities were small and information travelled slowly.

Industrialisation changed that. When employers began hiring strangers at scale, they needed a fast, cheap filter. The modern university degree emerged as exactly that filter. It bundled three signals into one piece of paper: cognitive ability (you could handle four years of intellectual work), conscientiousness (you showed up and finished), and socialisation (you absorbed the norms of a professional class). Employers did not need to know what you studied in your third-year seminar. They needed to know you survived the process.

The Prussian education system of the 18th century established compulsory schooling, standardised curricula, and state certification -- a template that spread globally and entrenched the idea that credentials should be issued by institutions authorised by the state. Over two centuries, this model became so deeply embedded in regulation, professional licensing, and cultural expectation that questioning it felt almost absurd.

By the late 20th century, the degree had become what sociologists call an "institutional fact" -- valuable not because of what it contained but because everyone agreed to treat it as valuable. Employers required degrees. Governments subsidised them. Professional bodies mandated them. Parents expected them. The cycle reinforced itself.

### The Degree Premium -- and Its Limits

The economic case for degrees remains real. Across OECD countries, graduates earn significantly more over a lifetime than non-graduates. But this premium is an average that conceals enormous variation by field, institution, and individual. A computer science degree from a well-regarded university pays for itself many times over. A degree in a field with weak labour-market demand from an institution with high dropout rates may leave a graduate worse off than someone who entered the workforce directly.

Grade inflation has further eroded the degree's informational value. When students are treated as customers entitled to high grades, the signal weakens. An A no longer reliably distinguishes deep understanding from surface compliance. Employers notice. As one hiring manager put it, degrees tell you someone finished something -- but not what they can actually do.

## What Is Changing?

### The Employer Shift Toward Skills

Skills-based hiring has moved from conference rhetoric to measurable practice. In 2025, 81% of employers globally report using skills-based approaches, up from 73% in 2023. In Europe, 77% of companies plan to prioritise competency-based recruiting in 2026. The talent pool expansion is striking: skills-based hiring increases the pool of eligible candidates by 15.9 times in the United States and 10.4 times in the United Kingdom. For Gen Z workers, the multiplier reaches 17.6 times in the U.S. and 12.7 times in the UK.

These numbers reflect a genuine structural shift, not a temporary fashion. The persistent talent shortage -- cited by 24% of global CEOs as a primary business threat -- forces employers to look beyond traditional credential filters. When you cannot find enough people with the right degree, you start asking what people can actually do.

AI-powered skills assessments, used by 41% of talent acquisition teams, make this feasible at scale. Online simulations, gamified tests, and project-based evaluations provide data that a resume cannot. Some 83% of companies now use some form of gamified assessment. The technology that makes degrees less necessary for filtering also makes alternatives more practical.

### Portfolios and Demonstrated Capability

The shift from credentials to portfolios is already visible in specific industries. In software development, a GitHub profile with real contributions often matters more than a degree listing. In design, a portfolio of shipped products is the entry requirement. In data science, a well-documented Kaggle competition or a published analysis demonstrates capability in ways a transcript cannot.

Projects are becoming the new transcripts. In a world where AI can generate standard answers, creation is the only honest proof of competence. The question is no longer "What school did you attend?" but "What have you built?"

This shift is accelerated by the economics of verification. AI makes it cheap to assess skills through projects, simulations, and portfolios. When verification is expensive and slow, employers default to institutional proxies like degrees. When verification becomes fast and cheap, the proxy loses its monopoly.

### Blockchain Credentials and Verifiable Trust

Resume fraud and credential verification bottlenecks cost employers billions annually. Blockchain-based credentials offer a technical solution: cryptographically verifiable proof of education, certifications, and employment history. Platforms like TrueProfile.io, Blockcerts, and Credly by Pearson create immutable digital records that employers can verify instantly.

The European approach is particularly ambitious. The European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU) became the first European University Alliance to issue jointly recognised, blockchain-secured digital micro-credentials using the Europass wallet in 2023. Open Badges 3.0, introduced in 2022, integrates blockchain technology with verifiable credentials, creating a decentralised system where each badge contains detailed metadata -- learning path, objectives achieved, criteria met -- embedded in a digital wallet that learners own and control.

The European Blockchain Partnership is developing unified standards for interoperable credential verification across the single market. North America leads in private-sector implementation, particularly in tech and healthcare where certification is critical.

Beyond fraud prevention, blockchain credentials enable lifelong learning records where workers accumulate micro-credentials from multiple sources, automated skill matching where AI systems read verified credentials without manual data entry, and simplified cross-border recognition of foreign qualifications.

### AI-Verified Work and Behavioural Signals

Perhaps the most disruptive development is still emerging: AI systems that assess not just what you know or what you have built, but how you work. Adaptive learning platforms already track trajectory rather than just status -- measuring learning velocity, the speed at which a student can unlearn, pivot, and build again. Predictive analytics evaluate behavioural patterns: consistency, collaboration habits, response to feedback, ability to sustain focus over time.

These behavioural signals are qualitatively different from traditional credentials. A degree tells an employer what you survived. A portfolio shows what you built. A behavioural profile shows how you operate -- and whether you are likely to keep growing. In recruitment, AI algorithms already evaluate factors like job change frequency, behavioural traits, and assessment responses to flag candidates likely to leave early or to forecast on-the-job performance.

The ethical implications are significant -- algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, and the risk of reducing people to data patterns are real dangers. But the direction of travel is clear: the information available to employers about candidates is becoming richer, more granular, and more continuous than a degree could ever be.

## The Four-Layer Signalling Stack

Rather than replacing degrees with a single alternative, we are moving toward a layered system. Think of it as a signalling stack, where different layers carry different weight depending on the context.

### Layer 1: Baseline -- Degrees

Degrees are not going away. In regulated professions -- law, medicine, engineering, nursing, teaching, architecture -- they remain hard gates enforced by professional bodies, government regulation, and liability frameworks. You cannot practise medicine without a medical degree, regardless of how impressive your portfolio is. You cannot sign off on a bridge design without an accredited engineering qualification. These gates exist for good reasons: they protect the public from unqualified practitioners in fields where mistakes can kill.

Even outside regulated professions, degrees serve as a baseline signal that is difficult to replicate. They certify a sustained period of intellectual engagement, exposure to a discipline's methods and debates, and the ability to complete a multi-year commitment. For entry-level hiring, where candidates have little work history, this baseline remains useful.

The degree's role, however, is narrowing. It is becoming a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition in many fields rather than the dominant signal it once was.

### Layer 2: Skill -- Micro-Credentials, Short Courses, Certifications

Micro-credentials address labour-market velocity by unbundling degrees into smaller, skill-focused units. Typically 4-6 ECTS in size, they certify specific competencies and can stack toward larger qualifications or stand alone. A 2024 survey found that 60% of hiring managers consider alternatives to traditional degrees, and 92% report they would hire candidates with GenAI micro-credentials.

Harvard Extension School permits two-course micro-certificates and three-course certificates to accumulate toward bachelor's or master's degrees. Miami Dade College maps stackable pathways from short college-credit certificates through career-technical certificates to full degrees. The European approach aligns micro-credentials with Bologna structures -- EQF levels, ECTS, quality assurance -- to ensure cross-border recognition.

Industry certifications from companies like Google, AWS, Microsoft, and Salesforce operate in the same layer. They signal current, specific, verifiable skills in a way that a four-year degree issued a decade ago cannot.

### Layer 3: Evidence -- Portfolios, Projects, Simulations, Code Repositories

This layer provides direct evidence of capability. It includes GitHub repositories, design portfolios, published analyses, open-source contributions, completed simulations, and documented project outcomes. Unlike credentials, which certify that someone once demonstrated competence, evidence shows what someone can do right now.

VR and AR assessment technologies are expanding this layer. Walmart uses VR to place candidates in high-pressure retail scenarios, observing decision-making under stress. Manufacturing firms create virtual factory floors where candidates troubleshoot equipment failures. Healthcare organisations simulate patient interactions to evaluate clinical judgment. These immersive assessments generate objective, standardised data that AI can analyse for pattern matching against top performers.

Project-based hiring platforms enable candidates to complete real-world tasks, giving companies direct insight into work approach and quality. Software companies present coding challenges mirroring actual product problems. Marketing agencies ask candidates to develop campaign concepts. These exercises reveal not just technical skill but creativity, problem-solving approach, and professional judgment.

### Layer 4: Behaviour -- AI-Derived Patterns

The newest and most speculative layer -- one that does not yet exist at scale -- would capture behavioural signals derived from how people learn and work over time. Learning velocity -- how fast someone adapts to new material, detects errors, and iterates -- is measurable through adaptive platforms. Collaboration patterns, consistency of output, and response to feedback can be tracked across digital work environments.

This layer is embryonic and raises serious questions about privacy, bias, and consent. But it represents the logical endpoint of a trend: employers want to predict future performance, and AI systems can now infer patterns from behavioural data that no credential or portfolio captures.

The signalling stack is not a hierarchy where higher layers are better. Different employers, industries, and career stages will weight the layers differently. A hospital hiring a surgeon will care overwhelmingly about Layer 1. A startup hiring a developer will focus on Layer 3. A large corporation filling a mid-career role might weight Layer 2 and Layer 4 most heavily. Most people will navigate a stack, not rely on a single credential.

## Degrees Are Not Dead -- Yet

The narrative that degrees are dying makes for compelling conference talks. The reality is more textured.

### Where Portfolios Already Dominate

In software engineering, design, data science, and parts of the creative industries, portfolios and demonstrated work have become primary hiring signals. Many leading tech companies -- including Google, Apple, and IBM -- have publicly dropped degree requirements for a significant share of roles. The 42 School model, now spanning 54 campuses across 31 countries, awards certificates rather than formal degrees; employers report that its graduates excel at independent problem-solving and are less reliant on supervisor direction.

In these fields, the evidence layer of the signalling stack already outweighs the baseline layer. What matters is what you have shipped, not where you studied.

### Where Degrees Remain Hard Gates

In medicine, law, engineering, nursing, accounting, teaching, pharmacy, and architecture, degrees are not preferences -- they are legal requirements. Professional licensing bodies, government regulations, and liability insurance frameworks mandate specific educational credentials. These requirements exist because the consequences of incompetence in these fields are severe and often irreversible.

Changing these gates requires regulatory reform, not just employer preference shifts. It requires changes to professional body governance, liability and insurance models, and public trust frameworks. These changes happen slowly -- measured in decades, not product cycles.

### The Messy Middle

Most professions fall between these extremes. Business, communications, marketing, human resources, project management -- these fields nominally require degrees, but the requirement is softening. Skills-based hiring expands the talent pool, but many employers still use degree requirements as a first filter, even when they say they do not.

The gap between stated policy and actual practice is significant. Companies announce skills-based hiring initiatives; hiring managers still sort resumes by university name. The cultural inertia of credentialism runs deeper than corporate policy changes can quickly reach.

## The Credential Inflation Problem

The United States is now home to over one million unique educational credentials -- a threefold increase since 2018. This explosion includes offerings from universities, industry providers, bootcamps, and platforms, creating what observers call "micro-credential inflation."

When credentials proliferate faster than quality assurance can keep pace, the result is noise, not signal. Close to half of employers (46%) cannot assess the quality of a non-degree credential when a job applicant lists one. Forty-two percent cannot judge the skills and competencies acquired. A systematic review found that 80% of employers cite consistency as their primary concern: without standardised definitions, learning outcomes, or assessment rigour, micro-credentials vary wildly in value. Authenticity concerns follow: 38% of studies report employer worry about fraudulent credentials.

For learners, the landscape is equally confusing. Forty percent report not knowing where to start in the digital credential landscape. Sixty percent worry that costs will be out of reach despite marketing promises of affordability. The promise of stackability -- earning smaller credentials that accumulate toward degrees -- often fails in execution. Without thoughtful curricular design, stackable credentials become disjointed modules lacking coherent progression.

The irony is sharp: micro-credentials were supposed to solve the problem of degree inflation. Instead, we risk replacing one form of credential inflation with another, more fragmented one. Government financial aid rarely covers micro-credentials, creating a 23% barrier to adoption. Forty-three percent of the literature notes that micro-credentials deliver competencies limited to one specific niche of a job scope, restricting career mobility and adaptability.

## Employer Confusion and the Trust Gap

The signalling stack only works if employers can read it. Right now, many cannot.

When a candidate presents a traditional degree, the employer has a rough mental model of what it means -- imperfect, but shared. When a candidate presents a collection of micro-credentials, a GitHub profile, three online certificates, and a portfolio link, the employer faces a parsing problem. Which of these are rigorous? Which are vanity certificates from a weekend course? How do they compare to one another or to a degree?

This trust gap is the central obstacle to the new signalling system. Blockchain verification solves the authenticity problem -- you can confirm that a credential is real. But it does not solve the quality problem -- you still cannot tell whether the credential is worth anything. The default employer response remains what researchers call "trust but verify": employers ask their own questions to confirm knowledge rather than relying on the credential itself.

Without robust quality assurance frameworks, transparent metadata standards, and shared recognition systems, the signalling stack risks fragmenting into a confusing patchwork that serves no one well. The European approach -- embedding micro-credentials within national qualifications frameworks, linking them to established quality assurance processes, and using blockchain for verification -- offers one path forward. But implementation remains uneven across countries.

## Time Horizons: What Changes When

### Short Term (Next 5 Years)

The following projections extrapolate from current trends; they are informed estimates, not certainties. In the near term, the most likely scenario is a hybrid world where degrees remain the default for most professional hiring, but skills-based assessments increasingly supplement them. The 81% of employers using skills-based approaches will likely continue to grow, but degree requirements will persist in job listings even as enforcement softens.

If current adoption curves hold, micro-credentials will gain traction in technology, healthcare upskilling, and corporate training -- sectors where specific, current skills matter most. Blockchain credential verification may move from pilot projects to early mainstream adoption, particularly in Europe where regulatory infrastructure is further along.

Portfolios will likely become standard expectations in software, design, and data roles. In other fields, they will probably remain a differentiator rather than a requirement.

The most immediate change will be in how AI reshapes the hiring process itself. With 72% of North American organisations and 59% of European organisations already using AI in HR functions, automated screening is increasingly positioned to evaluate skills evidence alongside -- and sometimes instead of -- credential filters.

### Medium Term (Next 10 Years)

Over the next decade, it is plausible that the signalling stack will become more legible. Quality assurance frameworks for micro-credentials are likely to mature, driven by European regulatory leadership and employer demand for consistency. The European Commission's joint European degree label, rolling out from mid-2026, may establish templates for cross-border credential recognition.

One plausible scenario is that blockchain-based credential wallets become standard infrastructure, enabling learners to accumulate verified credentials from multiple sources -- universities, employers, platforms, professional bodies -- in portable digital portfolios that AI systems can parse automatically.

Behavioural signals may enter mainstream hiring over this period. Adaptive learning platforms, internal mobility systems, and AI-powered career guidance tools are already generating data about how people learn and work. Companies using internal mobility platforms report filling 30-40% of roles internally today, and if this trajectory continues, that proportion will grow as behavioural data improves matching.

It is also plausible that regulated professions will begin exploring competency-based alternatives to traditional degree pathways, though regulatory change will be slow and contested. Some jurisdictions may introduce "alternative qualification pathways" that allow demonstrated competence to substitute for portions of traditional degree requirements.

### Long Term (Next 20 Years)

The following is explicitly speculative -- extrapolating two decades out from current trends involves substantial uncertainty. Over twenty years, if the forces described above continue, the degree's monopoly on professional signalling would substantially weaken outside regulated professions. The signalling stack could mature into a broadly understood, interoperable system where different layers are weighted by context. Hiring a surgeon would still require Layer 1. Hiring a product manager might rely primarily on Layers 2, 3, and 4.

For degrees to truly recede, several structural changes would need to occur: regulatory reform of professional licensing, adaptation of liability and insurance models, shifts in public trust frameworks, and cultural change in how families, communities, and institutions value credentials. These are generational changes, not policy tweaks.

The most transformative -- and most speculative -- possibility is that AI-derived behavioural data becomes reliable and trusted enough to serve as a primary signal for many roles, effectively replacing the degree's function as a proxy for cognitive ability and conscientiousness with direct measurement. This would represent a fundamental shift in how societies sort people into opportunities. Whether it leads to greater meritocracy or to new forms of algorithmic discrimination depends entirely on the governance frameworks we build around it.

The most realistic twenty-year scenario, in our view, is not the death of degrees but their demotion from monopoly signal to one signal among several -- still important, still valued, but no longer sufficient on its own and no longer necessary for a growing range of careers.

## What This Means for You

Whether you are a student choosing a path, a mid-career professional navigating change, or an employer redesigning how you hire, the signalling stack has practical implications.

**If you are a student:** A degree still matters, but it is no longer enough. Start building your evidence layer early -- projects, contributions, documented work that shows what you can do. Choose micro-credentials strategically to complement your degree, not to replace it. Develop the habits that will generate strong behavioural signals: consistency, collaboration, willingness to learn publicly.

**If you are mid-career:** Your degree got you in the door years ago. What keeps you relevant is your skill and evidence layers. Invest in current certifications, maintain a visible body of work, and demonstrate that you are still learning. The half-life of skills is shrinking; a four-year degree from fifteen years ago tells employers less than what you built last quarter.

**If you are an employer:** Stop asking whether to require degrees or not. Start asking which layer of the signalling stack matters most for each role. Build assessment processes that can read multiple layers. Invest in quality frameworks that help your hiring managers distinguish rigorous micro-credentials from vanity certificates. And recognise that the transition will be messy -- the old system was imperfect but legible, and the new one is potentially better but currently hard to read.

**If you are a policymaker:** The signalling stack will not build itself into a coherent, trustworthy system without regulatory infrastructure. Quality assurance frameworks for micro-credentials, interoperability standards for digital wallets, and updated professional licensing pathways are public goods that markets alone will not provide. The European approach of embedding new credentials within existing qualification frameworks offers a model, but it needs sustained investment and cross-border coordination.

## Conclusion

The degree is not dead. But its monopoly is ending. We are moving from a world with one dominant signal to a world with a layered signalling system -- degrees, skills, evidence, and behaviour -- where different layers matter in different contexts.

This transition carries real risks. Credential inflation, employer confusion, and fragmentation could produce a system worse than the one it replaces -- noisier, more expensive, and more unequal. The United States already has over one million unique credentials, and most employers cannot tell them apart. Without shared standards, transparent quality assurance, and regulatory frameworks that keep pace with innovation, the new signalling stack could become a tower of noise rather than a ladder of opportunity.

But the direction is set. Employers need better information about what candidates can do. Learners need more flexible, affordable, and current ways to demonstrate competence. AI is making both verification and assessment cheaper and faster. The question is not whether the signalling stack emerges, but whether we build it well -- legible, fair, and genuinely useful -- or let it fragment into chaos.

The institutions, employers, and policymakers who understand this transition will shape it. Those who cling to the old monopoly of the degree or rush uncritically toward its replacement will find themselves on the wrong side of a structural shift that is already well underway.
