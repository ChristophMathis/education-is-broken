# Proposal 4: Internal Tensions and Unaddressed Counter-Cases

## Evaluation

Proposal 4 identifies two legitimate internal tensions that, if left unaddressed, weaken the manuscript's authority.

**On the elite selectivity problem (4.1):** The proposal correctly observes that the critique of Minerva, 42, and CBE is fundamentally about who they serve and who they exclude. Chapter 06 makes this case systematically: these models are "built for the students who need the least help" and "filter for privilege" by requiring self-direction, digital fluency, and prior academic preparation as entry conditions rather than learning outcomes. Yet Chapter 09's vision of universities as "crucibles of character" contains an unexamined assumption: that the hybrid university can somehow avoid reproducing this selectivity while relying on similar pedagogical forms (active learning, real-world projects, independence) that Chapters 04 and 06 have already shown privilege well-resourced learners.

The tension is real. The manuscript argues (correctly) that peer-driven models and campus-free universities succeed precisely because they filter for advantage, then proposes a university redesign that retains many of those same filtering mechanisms without fully confronting how to make them genuinely inclusive. This is not a small problem. It risks the charge that Krishan is offering a more sophisticated version of elite education and calling it a public university.

**On the crucible-and-cost problem (4.2):** Chapter 09 is compelling on what universities must be -- spaces for research, character formation, civic learning, deliberative practice. But the chapter provides no economic model for how institutions simultaneously deepen these functions (all capital-intensive, labor-heavy, high-touch) while facing the financial squeeze already documented in Chapter 02 (declining state funding, rising costs, growing financial pressure on traditional models). The absence is felt: a reader finishes Chapter 09 wanting to know not just "what should universities do" but "how will they possibly afford it."

The proposal notes that Chapter 09 briefly sketches five funding streams (public funding, tuition, corporate partnerships, platform revenue, endowments) but does not model how these work in concert, what trade-offs are unavoidable, or how a mid-tier university actually implements this architecture without ceding its mission to whichever funder grows loudest. This is not theoretical navel-gazing. It is the question institutional leaders actually ask.

Both tensions are addressable without rewriting chapters. They require targeted additions that acknowledge the contradictions honestly, then resolve them with concrete reasoning.

## Proposed Solution for 4.1 (Elite vs. Mass Systems)

**Problem:** Chapter 09 proposes that universities become "crucibles of character" through active learning, residential experience, community projects, and deliberation -- yet Chapter 04's and 06's analyses show these exact pedagogies filter for advantage. The manuscript risks proposing an elite model and calling it universal.

**Solution:** Add a substantial paragraph to Chapter 09, Section "The Crucible of Character -- Made Concrete," immediately after the opening subsection that lists the six structural elements (residential experience, community work, deliberation, student media, debate, labs). The paragraph should:

1. Acknowledge the selectivity problem directly and name the apparent contradiction
2. Argue that the difference between elite and mass crucibles is not the pedagogy, but the *support infrastructure* and *access requirements*
3. Propose concrete guardrails that make crucible practices genuinely inclusive

**Placement:** In Chapter 09, after the line "The common thread is that these experiences involve friction, stakes, and human interaction in ways that cannot be compressed into a module or automated by an algorithm." and before the section "Academic Freedom and Institutional Autonomy in an AI Era."

### The Selectivity Paradox: How Crucibles Avoid Reproducing Elite Bias

The preceding list of crucible practices -- residential cohorts, community projects, deliberative forums, student media, debate, research labs -- raises an uncomfortable question: are these not precisely the experiences that elite universities already offer? And if so, does calling for their expansion solve the problem of stratification, or simply suggest that broad access to elite education?

The answer depends entirely on design. The same pedagogies can either amplify or mitigate existing inequalities, and the difference lies not in the pedagogy itself but in the *institutional commitment to support* that surrounds it.

Elite universities work for self-directed, already-confident students because those students bring strong foundational skills, stable home environments, and implicit knowledge of institutional norms. A debate club at such an institution assumes participants already know how to argue, can tolerate social discomfort, and have role models for intellectual risk-taking. For these students, debate is enrichment. It accelerates what they already possess.

But a debate club designed as inclusive pedagogy -- for students without prior experience, from backgrounds where public argument is not a family norm, carrying anxiety or trauma that makes public speaking feel unsafe -- requires something entirely different. It requires a coach who understands developmental scaffolding. It requires smaller cohorts so students get individualized feedback rather than sinking into the background. It requires explicit instruction on how to construct arguments, not just exposure to good examples. It requires psychological safety work before intellectual combat. It requires mentors who look like students and come from similar backgrounds, to make the possibility of belonging feel real.

This is not a minor add-on. It is a structural redesign. And it costs more, not less, than the elite version.

The same principle applies to community projects. An elite student who grows up watching her parents navigate bureaucracy, negotiate with public officials, and think strategically about social change will treat a semester of work with a city government as applied learning. A first-generation student whose family experiences institutions primarily as imposing forces -- welfare offices, courts, immigration agencies -- may experience the same project as intimidating and incomprehensible, without explicit training in how to interpret institutional dynamics, ask questions, and recognize their own agency.

To make community work inclusive, universities must embed structured reflection, provide explicit frameworks for understanding institutional design, connect the work to broader concepts of power and change, and ensure that students from under-resourced backgrounds do not arrive at projects expecting to perform competence they do not yet have.

Again: this is more expensive and more labor-intensive than an elite version. It requires faculty and staff trained in developmental education. It requires smaller project teams. It requires follow-up mentoring. But it is the only way the pedagogy can honestly serve equity rather than simply redistribute elite advantage.

The core design principle is this: **the hybrid university must treat all the high-contact, high-stakes, character-forming experiences that make it excellent as pedagogies to be *learned*, not entry requirements to be *selected for*. This reversal -- from selection to development -- is what distinguishes a public crucible from an elite one.**

It has concrete implications:

- **Residential experiences must include intensive support.** Not every student needs four years on campus; some benefit more from part-time engagement. But the students who most benefit developmentally from residential living are often those least likely to afford it or feel they belong. Subsidizing housing costs and embedding mental health services, peer mentoring, and academic support within residential communities is not a luxury. It is what makes the residential crucible work for populations beyond the already-advantaged.

- **Community projects require structured mentorship and institutional partnership.** Students do not simply "apply learning." They need frameworks to interpret what they encounter, adults who can model professional and ethical judgment, and explicit teaching about how institutions work, where power resides, and what it means to challenge assumptions respectfully. This requires partnerships where community organizations and universities jointly design projects, provide mentoring, and treat student learning as a shared responsibility.

- **Deliberative forums need explicit preparation and psychological safety.** Not everyone arrives at university ready to argue in public. Building inclusive deliberative spaces requires teaching argument skills, creating structures where all voices are heard (not just the loudest), facilitating productive disagreement, and providing private spaces where students can process discomfort. It means faculty who understand how identity, power, and trauma shape participation, and who can make intellectual risk-taking feel survivable.

- **Student media, theater, and creative outlets require economic support.** These activities are often the first casualties at under-resourced institutions. But they are precisely where students who have never seen themselves as writers, artists, or leaders discover they can be. Making them sustainable requires institutional commitment: paid advisors, equipment budgets, and explicit recognition that these activities are pedagogy, not decoration.

- **Research labs must be accessible beyond the already-prepared.** Not every undergraduate should spend years in a lab; many thrive elsewhere. But laboratories should include pathways for students from under-resourced schools who have never encountered research, may not know it is a viable path, and need extra scaffolding to get there. This means mentors, bridge programs, and explicit teaching of lab culture and norms.

The principle throughout is the same: crucible experiences are powerful precisely because they involve stakes, friction, and real human judgment. But they need not be *exclusive*. The cost of inclusion is genuine institutional investment in development and support. The benefit is that the same experiences that shape the character of privileged learners can shape the character of students from any background -- if the institution commits to making that possible.

This is the crucible model's answer to the selectivity paradox: not avoiding high-contact, high-stakes experiences, but redesigning them so they develop capacity rather than assuming it, and funding them as core institutional functions rather than optional extras.

## Proposed Solution for 4.2 (Crucibles vs. Cost)

**Problem:** Chapter 09 articulates what universities must be (research, character, citizenship, cultural memory) but provides no credible model for how they finance these functions while facing pressures already documented (declining public investment, rising costs, competitive pressure). The five-part funding framework is sketched but not modeled, leaving institutional leaders without a concrete architecture for implementation.

**Solution:** Expand Chapter 09, Section "Funding Models for the Hybrid University" by adding a new subsection after the five funding streams are introduced. This subsection should:

1. Name the genuine trade-offs and unavoidable choices (no perfect solution exists)
2. Model a realistic funding composition for a mid-tier public research university
3. Show how this composition protects mission-critical functions from market pressure
4. Address the most likely failure modes and how to mitigate them
5. Acknowledge what this model does *not* solve and why

**Placement:** In Chapter 09, after the paragraph ending "...no single funder has veto power over institutional direction" and before the section "The Risk of Mission Drift."

**Proposed Text:**

### A Concrete Funding Architecture: How Mission Survives Market Pressure

The five funding streams described above are necessary components, but they are not a strategy. A strategy requires specifying how much revenue comes from each source, how that composition changes the incentives institutions face, and what safeguards protect core mission when markets shift. This section translates principle into practice by modeling a realistic funding composition and the choices it requires.

Consider a mid-tier public research university with 12,000 students, significant research output in STEM and social sciences, and a commitment to regional accessibility. In 2025, such an institution typically derives revenue as follows: roughly 30% from state appropriations, 35-40% from tuition and fees, 10-15% from research funding (grants, contracts), 5-10% from philanthropic revenue, and the remainder from auxiliary services, licensing, and other sources. This composition leaves the institution vulnerable: state funding has declined over decades, making the university heavily dependent on tuition, which creates incentives to focus on recruitment, retention, and satisfaction rather than intellectual rigor; research funding is competitive and volatile, favoring applied work with immediate outcomes; and philanthropic revenue is concentrated in elite institutions.

A mission-protective funding model would shift this composition deliberately. The goal is not to eliminate any revenue source but to rebalance so that no single source dictates institutional priorities.

**A protective composition might look like this:**

- **Public funding: 35-40% of revenue** (increase from current 30%, requiring political advocacy and demonstrated public benefit). This is the anchor function. Public funding should protect basic research capacity, subsidize tuition for lower-income students, and fund programs that serve the public good even when they do not maximize revenue. The trade-off: this requires universities to be vocal about their role in the public sphere, to measure and communicate public benefit beyond employment rates, and to accept public accountability for how funds are used. Public funding formulas should reward research output, retention of under-represented populations, and civic engagement, not just completion rates and employment outcomes.

- **Tuition and fees: 25-30% of revenue** (down from current 35-40%). Deliberately capping tuition revenue forces institutions to make hard choices about program portfolio and efficiency. It prevents the race to maximize enrollment and satisfaction metrics. It requires that institutions ask: which programs are essential to our mission, and which are we running only because they are profitable? Tuition levels should be means-tested and kept below thresholds that create prohibitive debt. Income-contingent repayment, where students pay a percentage of earnings rather than a fixed amount, protects access while maintaining revenue. This approach requires public policy support (federal or state income-contingent repayment systems) but is feasible and used successfully in Australia, the Netherlands, and parts of Scandinavia.

- **Research and grant funding: 15-20% of revenue** (stable or modestly increased). This revenue stream should fund research missions, not substitute for public funding of teaching and facilities. The risk is that grant-dependent institutions gravitate toward applied research that generates funding, away from basic research that generates knowledge. Protecting basic research capacity requires institutional choices: dedicating a portion of revenue to research that does not directly generate external funding, protecting faculty time for unfunded inquiry, and resisting pressure to treat all research through a commercialization lens. Some universities have created dedicated research funds, often small, that support high-risk, high-reward projects unlikely to attract external funding. This model works but requires universities to decline other revenue opportunities.

- **Philanthropy and endowment: 10-15% of revenue** (increase through capital campaigns, but with guardrails). Private philanthropy can fund innovation and expansion, but it is deeply unequal (a handful of elite institutions control the vast majority of endowment wealth) and creates risk of donor influence on mission. Universities dependent on individual major donors for core functions have limited independence. Protective policies include: endowment spending policies that limit distributions to sustainable percentages (typically 4-5% annually, not 100% payout), preventing short-term donor demands from depleting reserves; naming gift policies that limit how much naming rights can constrain academic program design; and diversified donor bases that prevent any single donor from holding vetoing power. Many universities fail at this last point, allowing major donors to shape curriculum, hiring, or research directions. The protective approach is to reserve philanthropic funding for genuinely new initiatives and innovation, not core functions.

- **Platform and credential revenue: 5-10% of revenue** (strategic addition, with constraints). As universities develop micro-credentials, online programs, and learning platforms, they can generate revenue from learners outside their traditional student body. This is legitimate income, but it requires structural separation from core degree programs and research missions. A protective model creates a separate continuing education or professional education division, ring-fences its revenue, and ensures it does not cannibalize the university's research and undergraduate missions. The revenue from this division should cross-subsidize public-good functions (making low-income access programs sustainable) rather than replace public funding.

**The protective principle:** Each revenue stream should finance functions aligned with its incentive structure. Public funding finances basic research and broad access. Tuition finances instruction and facilities. Research funding finances research production. Philanthropy finances innovation and expansion. Platform revenue finances scalable, modular offerings. No single source should exceed 40% of revenue, ensuring that no funder can dictate institutional direction.

**What this composition requires:**

This model requires universities to be strategically intentional about what they do well and what they decline to do. A mid-tier research university cannot be all things to all students. The protective funding model forces clarity: What research is our distinctive contribution? Who are we primarily accountable to? What programs serve our mission? What programs generate revenue but do not serve our mission? The hard choice is often the last one: universities will need to discontinue or significantly scale back programs that are popular and profitable but ancillary to their core mission -- professional master's programs that are essentially corporate training, online bachelor's degrees designed to maximize revenue, credential factories optimized for scale.

This is difficult. Programs generate constituency and revenue. But a university that is all things is credible at nothing. The protective model requires institutional leadership willing to say "we will not do that, even if it is profitable," and boards willing to back those choices.

The model also requires political advocacy. Public funding at levels that make it an anchor requires universities to demonstrate public benefit and to articulate why basic research, civic education, and cultural preservation are public goods worth funding. Many universities have ceded this argument to more vocal critics. The protective model requires universities to reclaim it, publicly and consistently.

**What this model does not solve:**

This architecture protects institutional autonomy and mission, but it does not solve the fundamental problem of rising costs. Universities are labor-intensive; they employ skilled faculty, administrators, counselors, and support staff. Salaries are rising to match market rates. Capital costs -- maintaining aging buildings, updating labs, investing in new technologies -- are substantial. Costs will continue rising faster than revenue in most scenarios.

This model does not prevent that. What it does is ensure that institutions facing cost pressures cannot simply abandon their public mission, cut research to preserve budgets, or shift entirely to employer-aligned training to maximize revenue. The funding architecture creates friction, requiring institutions to make explicit choices and trade-offs rather than drifting toward mission compromise.

The second thing this model does not do is address extreme inequality across institutions. Elite universities with massive endowments can pursue this model easily. Mid-tier public research universities can implement it with political will. Community colleges and regional universities face tighter constraints. For these institutions, the protective model requires significant public funding increases or regional partnerships that share costs and infrastructure. This is politically difficult but necessary if the goal is a diverse higher education system rather than a bifurcated one where elite institutions do the full mission and everyone else operates as a training facility.

The third limitation is that this model assumes stable or modestly increasing public investment in higher education. If public funding continues its long-term decline, no internal allocation can prevent mission drift. At that point, the question becomes systemic: Does a society still value the functions universities serve, and is it willing to fund them? The protective funding model answers that question by making it explicit. If public funding falls below the level required to protect research, broad access, and civic mission, then institutions cannot be blamed for abandoning those functions -- the society that failed to fund them has already made the choice.

## Summary

These two additions address the internal tensions directly:

**On selectivity:** The addition to "The Crucible of Character" section acknowledges that crucible pedagogies can either reproduce elite advantage or develop capacity more broadly, depending on support infrastructure and access design. It shows how the same high-contact, high-stakes practices can serve either exclusive or inclusive purposes, and specifies the concrete investments required to make them genuinely public. This closes the gap between the critique in Chapter 06 (showing that selective models filter for advantage) and the proposal in Chapter 09 (that universities should deepen character-forming experiences). The answer is: yes, deepen those experiences, but redesign them so they develop rather than select, and fund them as core institutional functions.

**On costs:** The addition to "Funding Models for the Hybrid University" provides a concrete, modeled funding composition for a mid-tier institution. It shows how to structure revenue streams to protect mission from market pressure, names the hard choices institutions will need to make, and acknowledges what the model does and does not solve. It moves from abstract principle to implementable strategy, giving institutional leaders a framework they can actually use while acknowledging the political and systemic constraints they face.

Both additions maintain Krishan's voice -- direct, evidence-grounded, acknowledging complexity without surrendering to it -- while filling genuine gaps that current readers would feel.
