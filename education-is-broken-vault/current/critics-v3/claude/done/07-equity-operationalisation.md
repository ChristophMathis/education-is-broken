# Proposal 7: Equity Logic — Operationalisation

## Evaluation

Chapter 6 is the book's most important argument. The diagnosis of the agency divide, selection bias in "self-directed" models, and the Matthew effect in university alliances is rigorous and uncomfortable—which means it works. The chapter treats equity not as an afterthought but as the central design constraint, and it backs that up with specific mechanisms: why abundance without support deepens inequality, why peer-driven schools filter for privilege, why alliances reproduce hierarchies.

What the chapter does not do is say who pays for equity to actually happen.

The "Non-Negotiable Design Features" section is essential but remains at the level of principle. It prescribes human coaching, bias audits, agency-building curricula, mobility stipends, and capacity-building for peripheral universities. These are not optional. But the chapter stops at the prescription and does not enter the politically difficult work of operationalisation.

Three gaps open up when you push on implementation:

### Gap 1: Financing
When the book prescribes "funded human coaching" for every AI tutoring system or "structured support for first-generation learners" in campus-free models, it assumes budgets that exist in wealthy institutions. But the students most harmed by abundance-without-support are those in underfunded systems: public universities in the Global South, lower-tier institutions in Central and Eastern Europe, community colleges in the United States operating under austerity.

The chapter does not address the hard question: if equity features require per-student costs that underfunded systems cannot absorb, what policy mechanisms force redistribution of funding across the system so that the institutions serving the poorest students have the resources to implement these features?

### Gap 2: Political Trade-Offs
The chapter identifies who wins and who loses under each model but avoids naming the policy interventions that would change the winners. Employer-sponsored education narrows curriculum and locks workers into companies—but the chapter does not propose that public funding come with accreditation standards that require breadth, or that worker mobility of credentials be legally mandated. University alliances concentrate prestige and funding in already-resourced institutions—but the chapter does not propose that alliance funding explicitly reserve 30% for peripheral institutions, or that participation eligibility favour under-resourced universities.

These are not soft recommendations. They are redistributive policies that make some actors worse off (or less enriched) to make others better off. The chapter's silence on these trade-offs means readers can accept the diagnosis while imagining painless solutions. That is a luxury equity does not afford.

### Gap 3: Teaching and Tutoring Labour
The book extensively discusses mental health infrastructure, coaching, mentoring, and human-centred support as the counterweight to AI abundance. But it says almost nothing about the conditions under which humans who provide this support actually work.

Coaches, tutors, mentors, and teachers are the delivery mechanism for equity. If they are underpaid, overworked, under-supported, and precarious—which they are in most systems—then prescribing more of their labour without addressing their working conditions is asking the already-squeezed to squeeze harder. A truly operationalised equity agenda must name teaching and tutoring as skilled professional work that requires competitive pay, reasonable workload, professional development, and job security. Otherwise, equity design becomes another invisible tax on already-vulnerable workers.

## Proposed Solution

The operationalised equity logic requires three types of interventions: financing mechanisms that redirect public and philanthropic resources toward underfunded systems, policy levers that constrain the political choices of institutions and corporations, and explicit investment in teaching and tutoring labour as the foundation of equitable learning.

### 1. FINANCING MECHANISMS

**Placement: End of Section 6, before "Non-Negotiable Design Features"**

The design anchors in this chapter—equity as design constraint, digital baselines, mental-health infrastructure, disaggregated outcomes—require new money flowing to underfunded systems, not just better allocation of existing budgets. Here is why the problem is structural, not just technical, and what operationalisation requires.

Coaching systems cost money per student. Algorithmic bias audits require specialist staff and independent review. Mental health infrastructure—counselors, crisis services, peer support coordination—requires more staff-to-student ratios than current systems maintain. Agency-building curricula require smaller class sizes and more instructor contact time than lecture-hall models allow. These are not optional improvements bolted onto existing systems. They are built-in requirements if equity outcomes are non-negotiable.

Yet they are also costs that fall disproportionately on the institutions that serve the students most likely to benefit from them—lower-income students, first-generation learners, students in under-resourced regions. This creates a perverse dynamic: the students who most need the supports cannot attend the institutions that have the budgets to provide them.

Operationalising equity requires three policy-level mechanisms:

**Tier 1: Redistributive Funding Formulas**

Public higher education funding must explicitly redirect resources from well-resourced to under-resourced institutions based on student demographics and institutional capacity. Not voluntary cross-subsidy—legal mandate. If a government funds higher education with public money, that money should be allocated such that institutions serving high percentages of low-income, first-generation, and minority students receive per-student funding no lower than institutions serving affluent populations.

In practice, this means funding formulas that:
- Weight student funding by socioeconomic status and educational background (e.g., 1.3x multiplier for first-generation low-income students).
- Account for regional cost differences but not regional wealth differences (do not penalise universities in lower-GDP regions).
- Reserve minimum percentages of competitive research funding for mid-tier universities so that prestige and funding do not concentrate entirely at the top.
- Tie institutional expansion or fee revenue to demonstrated recruitment and support of disadvantaged students.

This will be resisted by well-funded institutions. They will argue it reduces their capacity for excellence or research competitiveness. This is true. Equity and unlimited growth at elite institutions are incompatible. The choice is explicit: either the system prioritises access and support for the broadest population, or it prioritises pre-eminence for a subset. Both are legitimate choices, but institutions should not be allowed to claim they are pursuing equity while maintaining all other advantages. That is not equity—it is marketing.

**Tier 2: Philanthropic Capital with Accountability**

Large philanthropic foundations are increasingly interested in education equity and skills development. Currently, much of this capital goes to innovative models (bootcamps, peer-driven schools, alternative credentials) that, as this chapter shows, often replicate privilege under new brands.

Operationalised equity requires that foundations explicitly direct capital toward:
- Funding equity infrastructure in traditional public universities and community colleges serving low-income populations (not replacing public funding, but supplementing it).
- Building coaching, mentoring, and support systems in institutions where students are most likely to be under-supported.
- Financing longitudinal studies that track outcomes for disadvantaged students across different models (bootcamps vs. community college vs. employer-sponsored programs) to actually measure who benefits over time.
- Requiring grantees to publicly report outcome data disaggregated by race, socioeconomic status, and first-generation status. If the foundation does not know who benefits, it cannot claim to be funding equity.

**Tier 3: Fee Regulation and Revenue Redistribution**

Many institutions now rely heavily on tuition from fee-paying (especially international) students to balance budgets. This creates perverse incentives: institutions prioritise revenue-generating students over scholarship students or students from lower-income domestic backgrounds.

Operationalising equity means regulating this behaviour through:
- Caps on the percentage of institutional revenue that can come from international or full-pay domestic students (e.g., no more than 40% of revenue).
- Requirements that excess revenue from fee-paying students be directed toward scholarships for low-income domestic students or toward support services, not executive compensation or new luxury facilities.
- Public reporting of the distribution of financial aid by demographic group, with accreditation consequences if disparities are unjustified.

These are not market-friendly policies. They work by constraint, not competition. They are also necessary if public institutions are expected to serve an equity mandate while operating under budget pressure.

### 2. CONSTRAINING INSTITUTIONAL AND CORPORATE CHOICES

**Placement: After the Who Wins/Who Loses boxes in Sections 4 and 5**

Equity design principles only work if policy actively constrains the choices institutions and employers make. Without constraint, the designs become suggestions, and institutions choose the cheaper, less equitable option.

**For Employer-Sponsored Education:**

If workers are to genuinely benefit from employer-funded learning, three constraints must be law or regulation, not best practice:

- **Credential Portability and No Clawback.** Any credential earned through employer funding belongs to the worker, not the employer. Workers must be able to transfer credits and use credentials with other employers without penalty or forfeiture. No "golden handcuff" contracts that require repayment if the worker leaves before a certain date. This is non-negotiable if the model is not to become a mechanism for worker lock-in disguised as upskilling.

- **Mandatory Breadth and Transferability Standards.** Employers fund training because they benefit from it. But accrediting bodies must establish standards that prevent employer-funded education from becoming pure skills-dumping: narrow technical training with no grounding in critical thinking, communication, or fields the employer does not directly need.

If a worker completes an employer-sponsored programme, they should be able to transfer credits into other degree programmes, not be stuck with a non-portable credential. This requires overriding institutional and employer resistance to "our credential is not transferable unless we approve." If public or philanthropic money subsidises education, transferability is not optional.

- **Transparency and Auditing.** Employers must report annually on who participates in funded programmes (disaggregated by role level, tenure, race, gender), who completes them, who gets promoted following completion, and who leaves during or after. If employer-sponsored education primarily benefits workers already on a management track, that should be visible and should trigger policy response.

**For University Alliances and Cross-Border Systems:**

The Matthew effect concentrates benefits among the already-advantaged. Constraining this requires:

- **Mandatory Peripheral-Institution Allocation.** At least 30% of alliance funding and mobility slots must go to institutions ranked outside the top 500 globally or designated as under-resourced by the system's own criteria. This is not charity—it is a condition of public funding.

- **Reverse Mobility.** Do not just move students from peripheral to core institutions. Also place students and early-career researchers from core institutions into peripheral universities for extended placements (semester or year-long). Prestige flows both directions, and knowledge transfer is bidirectional.

- **Coordinated Funding for Capacity-Building.** Before peripheral institutions can meaningfully participate as equals, alliance members must invest explicitly in their research infrastructure, international office capacity, and faculty professional development. This investment should be separate from participation costs. Expecting institutions to pull themselves up by bootstraps while paying to join is pretending at equity.

**For "Self-Directed" and Peer-Driven Models:**

If these models are to serve populations beyond the privileged, they must include:

- **Mandatory Scaffolding Pathways.** Do not let 42 School and similar models operate on pure sink-or-swim selection. Require that any institution claiming to be a scalable educational model include bridging or developmental pathways that prepare students who do not arrive with strong self-direction. This is a condition of operating in public systems or receiving public subsidy.

- **Diversity and Inclusion Audits.** Institutions must track who applies, who is admitted, who persists, and who succeeds, disaggregated by background. If you are filtering for privilege under the guise of merit, that should be visible. External auditors (not the institutions themselves) should review these data annually. Systemic under-representation should trigger required changes to selection or support processes.

### 3. TEACHING AND TUTORING LABOUR AS FOUNDATION

**Placement: New subsection in "Non-Negotiable Design Features," immediately after the introduction**

Every equity intervention in this chapter depends on humans: coaches who notice struggling students, mentors who model persistence, teachers who redesign curriculum, tutors who work with AI systems alongside learners. Yet teaching and tutoring are treated as infinitely elastic labour—always available, always underpaid, always overworked.

Operationalised equity requires treating teaching and tutoring as skilled professional work with commensurate conditions.

**Teaching and Tutoring Workforce Requirements:**

- **Competitive Pay.** Coaches, tutors, and learning mentors must earn professional-level salaries competitive with other skilled roles, not adjunct wages or gig-economy rates. A coach working with first-generation students in an AI tutoring system is doing skilled work: diagnosis, relationship-building, motivation management, navigation of complex systems. Pay must reflect this.

- **Workload Standards.** Coaching and mentoring are high-touch, emotionally demanding work. Standard workload caps should be 15-20 students per coach per semester if the goal is genuine relationship and early-warning capacity. Scaling coaching from 15 students to 50 "per coach" (usually meaning online office hours) eliminates the mechanism by which it works. If an institution cannot afford proper coaching loads, it should not promise coaching as an equity feature.

- **Professional Development and Continuity.** Coaches, tutors, and mentors need ongoing training—in subject matter, in trauma-informed practice, in use of new tools and platforms, in understanding student populations. Investment in staff development is not a luxury; it is what separates coaching from warehousing.

- **Job Security and Pathway.** Much tutoring and coaching is done by precarious adjuncts, part-time workers, or contract staff with no stability and no pathway to permanent positions. This creates high turnover, which undermines the relational continuity that makes coaching work. If equity depends on sustained human relationships, those humans need employment security.

This means institutions must budget for permanent coaching positions with benefits, not cheap freelance labour. It is more expensive. It is also the only way the model works.

**Integration with AI and Automation:**

AI tutoring systems are often framed as cost-reducers: replace expensive human instruction with cheaper AI delivery. But if equity is the design constraint, the relationship inverts. AI should reduce routine grading, administrative overhead, and scheduling complexity—freeing human coaches to do what only humans can do: notice students in crisis, offer mentorship, build judgment and resilience.

The operationalised equity model is not "replace teachers with AI." It is "use AI to expand the reach and efficiency of teaching so that human-intensive coaching and mentoring can scale to students who need it most."

This costs more, not less. If the institution is buying AI to cut costs while maintaining the same equity outcome, it is cutting equity to cut costs and deceiving itself about what has happened.

**Equity Infrastructure As System-Wide Choice:**

The staffing, pay, and working conditions of teachers and tutors are not administrative details. They are visible expressions of what an institution actually values. If the budget memo says "equity and student support are priorities," but the salary schedule pays coaches minimum wage, limits them to 30 students, and offers no benefits, then the institution does not actually prioritise equity. It prioritises the appearance of equity.

This is where the operationalisation becomes concrete and unavoidable. Equity is not a design principle or a slogan. It is a budget decision.

## Summary: The Three Operationalisation Levels

**Financing**: Redistribution of public funding toward under-resourced institutions serving disadvantaged students; philanthropic capital directed explicitly toward support infrastructure, not just innovation; revenue regulation to prevent institutions from off-loading equity work while maximising fee income.

**Policy Constraints**: Portability and no-clawback rules for employer-sponsored credentials; mandatory breadth standards for corporate education; reverse mobility and capacity-building in university alliances; mandatory scaffolding and diversity audits in selective models.

**Labour Foundation**: Teaching and tutoring positioned as skilled professional work with competitive pay, sustainable workload, professional development, and employment security.

These three levels are interconnected. You cannot have equity labour without financing; you cannot have redistributive financing without constraining institutions' ability to game it; you cannot have any of it without policy treating equity as a non-negotiable structural requirement, not a design choice.

The chapter's current argument is that equity is a design constraint. The operationalised argument is that equity is a choice about who controls resources, how institutions are constrained, and who gets paid for the work that inclusion requires. That choice is not inevitable. It is political.
