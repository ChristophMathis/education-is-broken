Here is a concise revision roadmap with structural, not cosmetic, changes.

## 1. Clarify scope and core thesis up front

Add a short “What this book actually claims” section at the end of Chapter 1.[^1]

- Precisely delimit scope: mainly higher education, corporate learning, and hiring in OECD/European contexts, with K‑12 as background.
- State the core thesis in one paragraph, distinguishing:
    - Descriptive claim (how education currently fails).
    - Explanatory claim (why these failures persist).
    - Normative claim (what a “good” AI-era system should do).
- Explicitly reconcile “education is broken” with “education is being rebuilt,” and position the book as describing a contested transition, not a single linear collapse.


## 2. Introduce an explicit systems model and reuse it

Create a short, reusable systems framework in “How Systems Actually Change (and Why It’s Slow)” and reference it across chapters.[^1]

- Define the core actors (students, universities, employers, governments, platforms) and a few key feedback loops (e.g., hiring → curriculum; funding → stratification; tech platforms → governance).
- Use the same diagram or conceptual schema to organise later chapters (“New Models,” “Degrees and the Signalling Stack,” “Learning in Companies,” “AI in Hiring”) so each chapter clearly shows which parts of the system it is mostly about.
- Tie the scenario chapter directly to this model (e.g., Drift = no change in loop X; Platform World = loop Y dominates; Redesign = new loop Z introduced).


## 3. Separate evidence from conjecture more systematically

Operationalise your methodological note throughout.[^1]

- For each chapter, add a small recurring box (“What we know vs what we are projecting”) that:
    - Lists 3–5 claims strongly grounded in Tier J/M evidence.
    - Labels 2–3 key forward-looking claims as scenario/hypothesis.
- Use consistent language markers: “evidence suggests…” vs “we argue…” vs “one plausible scenario is…”.
- For major forecasts (degree erosion, portfolio dominance, hybrid futures), explicitly tie them to scenarios and conditional assumptions instead of presenting them as the singular trajectory.


## 4. Build out a coherent treatment of the signalling and hiring logic

Make “Degrees, Skills, and the New Signalling Stack” the central spine for all claims about labour-market fit.[^1]

- Strengthen the “Why degrees are sticky” section (risk, regulation, status, simplicity) before discussing erosion; then reuse those constraints when talking about AI in hiring and corporate learning.
- Explicitly cross-reference:
    - “Intelligence Factory” (portfolios, projects) → “Signalling Stack” → “AI in Hiring.”
- For each signal layer, specify:
    - Who pays, who verifies, who benefits, who is excluded.
    - How it behaves in Drift, Platform World, and Redesign.
This will align your labour-market narrative and avoid inconsistent claims about speed and depth of change.


## 5. Tighten and deepen the equity through-line

Turn the stratification chapter into a design constraint that is referenced everywhere else.[^1]

- At the end of “The Stratification Trap,” extract 4–5 “non-negotiable design constraints” (e.g., digital baselines, support for low-agency learners, portability and data rights, mental-health infrastructure, redistributive funding).
- In each subsequent prescriptive or descriptive chapter (“New Models,” “Learning in Companies,” “AI in Hiring,” “Universities as Public Institutions”), add a short subsection or table:
    - “How this model fares against the equity constraints” (where it helps, where it worsens, what must be added).
- This will prevent the book from reading as if equity is a separate chapter rather than the test for every proposed model.


## 6. Make scenarios the explicit organising frame for futures, not an appendix

Elevate “Three Futures for Education” from a final thought experiment to a backbone.[^1]

- Early in the book (end of “How Systems Actually Change”), briefly introduce Drift, Platform World, and Redesign as the three macro-futures.
- When making strong future claims in other chapters (e.g., “the realistic future is hybrid,” “portfolios will dominate X”), explicitly tag them as applying primarily in one scenario.
- In the final scenario chapter, systematically revisit:
    - The four dimensions of brokenness.
    - The signalling stack.
    - Equity constraints.
For each scenario, show how they look if that future materialises.
This increases coherence and intellectual honesty around uncertainty.


## 7. Integrate pedagogy, agency, and “crucible” claims with cost and governance

Currently, “crucible of character,” agency, and first-principles thinking are strong normative elements but under-integrated with your cost/governance story.[^1]

- In “Universities as Public Institutions in an AI Era,” add one compact section that:
    - Specifies what crucible experiences look like pedagogically (e.g., high-challenge, high-support, authentic projects).
    - Estimates their resource implications qualitatively (smaller groups, more mentoring, different staff mix).
    - Links these implications directly to funding models and governance constraints described earlier.
- Revisit the “self-directed learners” critique and clearly state how institutions can scaffold agency (e.g., coaching, structured on-ramps, income support), so that your own hybrid/intelligence-factory vision does not presuppose already-privileged learners.

If you like, I can next draft a concrete restructured table of contents (with revised subheadings and cross-references) that implements this roadmap, or prototype one of the recurring boxes (“What we know vs what we are projecting”) for a specific chapter.
