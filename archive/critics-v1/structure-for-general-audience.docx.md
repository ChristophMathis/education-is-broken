# Structure For General Audience

For a general educated audience, it helps to streamline structure,
simplify signposting, and foreground “so what?”
implications.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **1. Overall structure and flow**

**Goal:** A clear, narrative arc from problem → forces of change →
emerging models → risks and choices.

Proposed high-level table of contents (renaming/merging chapters, not
rewriting everything):

1.  What Exactly Is Broken?

2.  The Rise of the Intelligence Factory

3.  How Systems Actually Change (and Why It’s Slow)

4.  New Models of Learning: What’s Already Here

5.  Degrees, Skills, and the New Signalling Stack

6.  The Stratification Trap: Who Gets Left Behind

7.  Learning in Companies: Second Chance or Parallel System?

8.  AI in Hiring: How Jobs Really Change Education

9.  Universities as Public Institutions in an AI Era

10. Three Futures for Education: Choice, Not Fate

Below are concrete placement suggestions using your existing
material.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **2. New or retitled chapters**

## **Chapter 1 – What Exactly Is Broken?**

Purpose: Give non-experts a precise starting point.

- Pull together: “Education is Broken” intro, major challenges for
  higher education, equity/wellbeing, and some enterprise/recruiting
  pain
  points.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Add 3–4 short sub-sections:

  - Learning and skills: We teach too slowly for a fast world.

  - Cost and access: Who can afford to learn?

  - Work and signals: Why employers are frustrated.

  - Human side: Stress, mental health, and loss of purpose.

- End with a simple 1–paragraph preview: “This book follows learners
  across universities, workplaces, and hiring to show how AI is
  reshaping all three.”

## **Chapter 2 – The Rise of the Intelligence Factory**

Purpose: Make the big metaphor concrete without sounding like sci‑fi.

- Base it on existing “Farewell to Traditional Universities,”
  “Intelligence factory vs. traditional university,” and “From batch
  processing to continuous
  optimization.”\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Add a clear subsection:

  - “Replace, complement, or layer?” explaining:

    - What AI can realistically replace (lectures, some assessment).

    - What it mostly complements (tutoring, analytics).

    - What still needs institutions and people (research, community,
      character, public
      mission).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Include a simple comparison table for readers:

(Use short, non-technical language.)

## **Chapter 3 – How Systems Actually Change**

Purpose: Slow down the jump from “AI can” to “education will.”

- Create a short, readable chapter using existing bits on governance,
  regulation, funding, and
  inertia.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Subsections:

  - Who decides? (governments, regulators, university leaders, faculty,
    employers, platforms).

  - What blocks change? (money, rules, culture, risk).

  - Why good ideas spread unevenly.

- Add one or two vivid examples (e.g., why micro-credentials take off
  faster in some countries than others).

## **3. Simplifying the innovation chapters**

## **Chapter 4 – New Models of Learning: What’s Already Here**

Purpose: Show concrete alternatives without drowning readers in detail.

- Merge your case study sections (CBE universities, Minerva, peer-only
  models, European alliances, Guild, etc.) into 4–5 archetypes:

  - Competency‑based online universities (WGU,
    SNHU).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

  - Global, campus-light models
    (Minerva).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

  - Peer‑driven and teacher‑free models (42
    School).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

  - Employer‑sponsored learning ecosystems
    (Guild).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

  - European alliances and micro‑credentials (ECIU,
    CHARM‑EU).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- For each archetype, keep a consistent simple pattern:

  - What is it in one paragraph.

  - Why it looks promising (1–3 bullet points).

  - What we know works (short evidence, clearly labelled).

  - What can go wrong (selection bias, equity, burnout,
    etc.).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

This pattern helps non-specialists compare without getting lost.

## **4. Making signals and labour markets digestible**

## **Chapter 5 – Degrees, Skills, and the New Signalling Stack**

Purpose: Resolve “degrees are dead” vs “degrees still rule” in everyday
terms.

- Combine your “From degrees to signals,” micro‑credentials, and
  recruiting‑trend
  material.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Structure it around three questions:

  - Why did degrees become so powerful?

  - What’s changing: portfolios, skills tests, AI‑verified work.

  - What’s realistic in the next 10–20 years.

- Introduce a simple “signalling stack” idea for readers:

  - Baseline layer: degrees (especially in regulated professions).

  - Skill layer: micro‑credentials, short courses.

  - Evidence layer: portfolios, projects, simulations.

  - Behaviour layer: AI‑derived patterns (consistency, collaboration,
    learning velocity).

Explain that most people will face a **stack**, not a single magic
credential.

## **5. Bringing equity and stratification to the centre**

## **Chapter 6 – The Stratification Trap: Who Gets Left Behind**

Purpose: Make the risks legible without technical jargon.

- Synthesize:

  - Agency divide.

  - Matthew effect in alliances.

  - Corporate capture.

  - Peer‑learning selection bias.

  - Digital divides and mental health
    gaps.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Use plain subheadings like:

  - When more opportunity means more inequality.

  - Why “self‑directed learners” are often the already privileged.

  - When companies own your learning path.

- For each major model, add a short “Who wins / who loses?” mini‑box in
  everyday language (e.g., “good for motivated adults with stable
  internet, bad for teenagers with chaotic home environments”).

## **6. Connecting enterprise learning and recruiting back to the big story**

## **Chapter 7 – Learning in Companies: Second Chance or Parallel System?**

Purpose: Help readers see corporate learning as part of the system, not
a side topic.

- Use your “Education in the Enterprise” and “Strategic Recommendations”
  material but:

  - Start with an anecdote: a worker whose main serious learning happens
    at work, not at school (you can fictionalize but keep it generic).

  - Add explicit reflections: “What companies can fix” vs “What they
    cannot and should not
    replace.”\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Finish with 3–4 simple messages aimed at normal readers:

  - Expect learning to be part of your job.

  - Expect your employer to care about credentials.

  - But don’t expect companies to take care of everything you should
    have learned earlier.

## **Chapter 8 – AI in Hiring: How Jobs Really Change Education**

Purpose: Bridge recruiting tech to education choices.

- From your recruiting chapters, keep what matters most to individuals:

  - How AI screens CVs and portfolios.

  - What “skills-based hiring” means in practice (and its limits).

  - New forms of assessment (simulations, projects,
    games).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- End with simple “implication for you” bullets:

  - Keep evidence of your work (projects, code, writing).

  - Don’t rely on one big degree.

  - Learn how to work *with* AI, not just next to it.

## **7. Making the public mission and futures visible**

## **Chapter 9 – Universities as Public Institutions in an AI Era**

Purpose: Balance “factory” talk with meaning, research, democracy.

- Reuse your “crucibles of character,” academic freedom, and governance
  sections, but rewrite for lay
  readers.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Explain, in simple terms:

  - Why societies still need places for research, debate, and cultural
    memory.

  - Why fully outsourcing learning to corporations or platforms is
    risky.

- Add concrete images: debate clubs, student newspapers, community
  projects, long-term basic science labs.

## **Chapter 10 – Three Futures for Education: Choice, Not Fate**

Purpose: End with scenarios, not tech determinism.

- Turn your scattered scenario hints into 3 vivid, short futures:

  - Business‑as‑usual but more unequal.

  - Platform‑dominated learning (companies + AI systems lead).

  - Deliberately redesigned public‑plus‑platform system.

- For each future, describe:

  - What life looks like for a typical 18‑year‑old and a 40‑year‑old
    worker.

  - What policy and institutional choices push us toward or away from
    it.

This gives a general audience a sense of agency instead of
inevitability.
