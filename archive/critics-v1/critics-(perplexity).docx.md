# Critics (Perplexity)

The document offers a rich, well-structured synthesis, but several
conceptual gaps, missing steps, and tensions run through
it.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

## **1. Framing “education is broken” vs. nuanced evidence**

- The core claim that traditional higher education is structurally
  obsolete (batch processing, lectures, degrees as weak signals, etc.)
  sits uneasily next to later sections that emphasize universities as
  crucibles of character, public goods, and research institutions. The
  argument never clearly reconciles “broken” with “still indispensable
  in X, Y, Z functions,” nor does it specify what “broken” means
  operationally (learning outcomes, equity, efficiency, macroeconomic
  returns?).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- The Intelligence Factory metaphor suggests a near-substitution of
  universities by AI-based infrastructures, but later case studies
  (Minerva, ASU, European alliances, etc.) are all hybrids that still
  rely heavily on institutional structures. The document does not
  explicitly argue whether the realistic future is replacement,
  symbiosis, or layered
  coexistence.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Primary/secondary education is mostly absent: the book title makes a
  system-level claim (“Education is Broken”), but almost all analysis
  concerns higher education + corporate learning, with only brief K–12
  mentions (Alpha School). That omission makes the systemic claim feel
  overstated.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Missing step:** A clear typology of what “broken” means across sectors
(K–12, higher ed, vocational, corporate) and what “success” indicators
would be in each.

## **2. From technological possibility to likely adoption**

- Many passages infer that because AI can provide personal tutors,
  adaptivity, and continuous optimization, institutions *will* or
  *should* adopt these at scale. Yet the later “pitfalls” section
  repeatedly shows how regulation, accreditation, faculty readiness,
  funding constraints, and stratification slow or distort
  adoption.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- There is no explicit causal chain: technical possibility → political,
  financial, and governance decisions → organizational change → changed
  learning outcomes. The text jumps from “AI makes X possible” to “the
  future system will look like Y,” leaving out hard constraints such as
  teacher unions, national funding formulas, or path dependencies in
  professions that still depend on traditional
  degrees.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Missing step:** A more explicit change model: who has power to change
what, under which incentives, and over what time horizon.

## **3. Labour market signals and degrees**

- Early sections argue that degrees are declining as meaningful signals
  and will be replaced by portfolios, projects, simulations, and
  micro-credentials. Later, the micro-credentials chapter highlights
  credential inflation, fragmentation, and employer confusion, with data
  that employers often cannot interpret non-degree credentials and
  default to their own
  screening.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Despite this, the conclusion still asserts a shift “from degrees to
  signals” without fully addressing the contradiction that the new
  signals are currently low-trust, noisy, and hard to
  standardize.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- The recruiting section shows that many AI-related and higher-paying
  roles *still* require degrees, and that skills-based hiring is uneven
  and often more rhetorical than real. This undercuts the implied
  imminence of a degree-to-portfolio transition, but the tension is not
  surfaced.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Missing step:** A clearer, evidence-based sequence: short-term
(degrees + some skills-based hiring), medium-term (hybrid signal
regimes), long-term (conditions under which degrees might truly recede).

## **4. Equity and stratification: acknowledged but not integrated**

- The text documents digital divides, selection bias in peer-learning
  models, the Matthew effect in European alliances, corporate capture in
  Guild-style models, and the agency divide in AI
  use.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- However, these equity concerns largely appear as “risks” at the end of
  sections, not as structuring constraints on the grand vision
  (intelligence factories, AI-first universities, stackable
  credentials).\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Example: the “agency divide” correctly notes that when high-quality AI
  tutors are abundant, advantage shifts from access to self-regulation
  and discipline. But the book does not connect this to earlier points
  about mental health, under-prepared students, or socio-economic
  differences that shape agency, nor does it propose institutional
  design elements that *systematically* build agency rather than
  assuming
  it.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Missing step:** A more explicit equity framework (e.g., who
benefits/loses in each model, how design can redistribute agency, which
safeguards are mandatory before scaling).

## **5. Weak integration between parts (university, enterprise, recruiting)**

- The structure promises a coherent story: higher education is broken,
  enterprises reinvent learning, recruiting changes accordingly. But the
  three parts mostly sit side-by-side rather than forming a tightly
  argued
  sequence.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- The enterprise section describes AI-enabled, skills-first corporate
  learning with strong quantitative claims (e.g., 25–40% faster skill
  acquisition, 20–40% lower turnover) but doesn’t connect back to the
  earlier assertion that universities are becoming obsolete as providers
  of initial qualification. For example, do corporate learning systems
  *replace* early-stage education, or mainly layer on top of
  it?\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Recruiting trends show how employers use AI and skills-based hiring,
  but the feedback loop into university program design, regional
  education policy, or credential frameworks is implied rather than
  spelled
  out.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Missing step:** An explicit system map: flows between universities,
corporate learning, and recruiting, with feedback loops (e.g., how
employer behaviour reshapes curricula and public funding decisions).

## **6. Evidence use and generalization leaps**

- Many sections cite strong quantitative claims (e.g., AI-powered
  learning platforms are “categorically superior across every measured
  dimension,” specific percentage improvements in retention, engagement,
  productivity). Often the origin of these numbers is vendor case
  studies or small-sample pilots, but the text generalizes them to
  system-level prescriptions without discussing external validity,
  industry/region differences, or negative
  cases.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Similarly, one meta-review is used to claim “hardly any evidence for
  the effectiveness of competence-based education,” but the book
  elsewhere leans on high-profile CBE institutions (WGU, SNHU) as
  exemplars. The contradiction is acknowledged in part, yet there is no
  clear guidance on when CBE works, for whom, and under what design
  constraints.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Missing step:** A more explicit hierarchy of evidence (pilot vs
large-scale, vendor vs independent, context-bound vs generalizable) and
more cautious claims where evidence is thin or contested.

## **7. Humanistic aims, research, and public mission**

- The text repeatedly insists that AI cannot provide purpose, taste,
  ethical judgment, or character, and that universities should become
  crucibles of identity formation and public-good
  missions.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- However, the main design principles and case studies are heavily
  weighted toward employability, skills gaps, corporate partnerships,
  and efficiency. Liberal arts, basic research, civic education, and
  knowledge creation for its own sake are treated mostly as “risks”
  (mission drift, corporate capture) rather than as affirmative design
  anchors.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- There is little discussion of how AI-era universities should be funded
  and governed if they are to maintain research and public missions
  while embracing modular, employer-aligned credentials and
  alliances.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Missing step:** A positive, worked-out model of AI-era universities
that takes research, democratic citizenship, and public knowledge
creation as core design constraints, not just side notes.

## **8. Normative vs descriptive stance**

- At many points, the text oscillates between describing trends (what
  *is* happening) and prescribing what *should*happen, often in the same
  paragraph. For instance, skills-first hiring is both a descriptive
  trend and a clear normative recommendation, but the book does not
  always separate “trend strength” from
  “desirability.”\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- Similarly, the portrayal of Alpha School, AI-first universities, and
  intelligence factories blends speculation, prototype cases, and strong
  normative enthusiasm, without thoroughly distinguishing speculative
  scenarios from empirically grounded
  trajectories.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

**Missing step:** Clear signalling of which claims are descriptive,
normative, or speculative—and what assumptions underlie the speculative
ones.

## **9. Missing or underdeveloped aspects**

Some important dimensions are barely touched or absent:

- **Regulatory and political economy detail:** While accreditation and
  EU initiatives are mentioned, there is little about national politics,
  lobbying by EdTech and platform firms, or teacher unions as actors
  that shape what is actually
  possible.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- **Student voice and lived experience:** Students appear mainly as
  “agents” or “consumers” in aggregate; there is limited qualitative
  engagement with how students experience AI tutors, CBL, or peer-only
  models beyond a few stress
  references.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- **Assessment validity and epistemology:** The shift from knowledge to
  capability is advocated, but there is little discussion of how we know
  that AI-era assessments reliably capture judgment, ethical reasoning,
  or systems thinking, and how AI involvement might distort those
  measures.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

- **Macro outcomes:** The document assumes that better alignment with
  labour markets and faster upskilling are desirable, but says little
  about broader societal outcomes: democratic resilience, inequality,
  social cohesion, ecological
  constraints.\[[<u>ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws</u>](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/72062884/1ced79fb-76aa-4862-a971-6af3a205e2dd/education-is-broken.pdf)\]​

If you like, I can next map these issues into a concrete “revision
blueprint” for the manuscript (which chapters to restructure, which
arguments to tighten, and where to insert new sections or diagrams).
