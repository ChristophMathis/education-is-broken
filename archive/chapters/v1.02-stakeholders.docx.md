Stakeholders in the shift of education span from individual learners and
educators to global organizations and corporate entities, each facing
distinct pressures and evolving roles.

**Students** Students are the primary stakeholders, currently facing a
transition from being processed in "herds" or "batches" to a system of
"continuous optimization" driven by AI,. In the context of higher
education, students are increasingly viewed—and view themselves—as
consumers who feel entitled to high grades by virtue of paying tuition,
a mindset that correlates with lower academic performance and critical
thinking skills,,. Furthermore, specific student populations, such as
neurodivergent learners, are critical stakeholders often underserved by
mandatory integration in mainstream schools, requiring environments that
allow for "unmasking" and specialized support rather than forced
adaptation,.

**Teachers and Educators** The role of the teacher is shifting from a
"broadcaster" of information to a "designer of learning experiences,"
acting as mentors, coaches, and guardians of standards,. However,
educators are currently facing high rates of burnout characterized by
emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, driven by rigorous
schedules, lack of resources, and the pressure to manage behavioral
problems,,. Teachers also face the dilemma of "grade inflation," often
pressured to award higher grades to placate students and avoid
retaliation in evaluations,.

**Educational Institutions and Administrators** Traditional universities
are major stakeholders currently competing with "intelligence factories"
that operate 24/7. These institutions face an existential threat: they
must transition from being "content delivery machines" to becoming "high
trust environments" for deep work and identity formation, or risk
becoming irrelevant,. Administrators are also implicated in systemic
issues; some critics argue they are incentivized to manipulate
statistics to maintain funding rather than focusing on actual education.

**Employers and Corporations** The corporate sector is shifting its
valuation of education. Employers are increasingly looking for
"demonstrated capability" and "signals" of value creation—such as
portfolios and projects—rather than relying solely on degrees, which are
becoming less effective as proxies for competence,. Additionally,
corporations themselves are stakeholders in educational policy; for
example, testing companies like Pearson are criticized for having
significant influence over public education policy to protect their
bottom line.

**Policymakers and Government Bodies** Government entities are
responsible for the infrastructure and funding of education. They are
criticized for politicizing education and failing to provide a seat at
the table for teachers regarding curriculum and standards. To address
crises like global "learning poverty," high-level national political
commitment is required to prioritize foundational skills and implement
recovery plans,. Furthermore, state-mandated standardized testing is a
point of contention, with critics arguing these mandates measure narrow
abilities rather than cognitive growth,.

**Families and Communities** Parents and families are essential
stakeholders, particularly in the context of learning recovery following
the COVID-19 pandemic. Successful acceleration of learning requires a
"national coalition" that includes families engaged in helping their
children learn. In the future of education, parents are encouraged to
shift their focus from prestige ("What school do you go to?") to agency
and creation ("What are you building?"). However, socio-economic factors
heavily influence a family's ability to support education, with the
digital divide and lack of connectivity exacerbating learning losses for
poorer households.

**International Organizations** On a global scale, organizations such as
the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF are stakeholders working to address
"learning poverty" and the loss of human capital,. They advocate for
evidence-based strategies, such as the RAPID framework, to recover
learning losses and ensure that all children acquire foundational
literacy,.
