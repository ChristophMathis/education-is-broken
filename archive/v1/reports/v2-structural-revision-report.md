# V2 Structural Revision Report

## Overview

This report synthesizes the four critics documents and maps them to a concrete restructuring plan for v2 of *Education is Broken*. The v1 manuscript contains 11 chapter files organized in three loose parts (higher education chapters 01-06, recruiting chapters 11-13, enterprise chapters 20-21). The critics identify nine structural problems and propose a 10-chapter architecture for a general audience.

## Key Problems Identified by Critics

### 1. Unclear core thesis
The claim "education is broken" is never operationally defined. The book covers higher education and corporate learning but barely touches K-12, making the systemic claim feel overstated. "Broken" needs dimensions: learning outcomes, equity, cost, labour-market fit.

### 2. Technology-to-adoption gap
The manuscript jumps from "AI can do X" to "the future will look like Y" without a causal chain through politics, funding, governance, regulation, faculty readiness, and path dependencies.

### 3. Unresolved degree-vs-portfolio tension
Early chapters declare degrees are declining signals. Later chapters show employers can't interpret non-degree credentials, skills-based hiring is uneven, and many roles still require degrees. The contradiction is never surfaced.

### 4. Equity as afterthought
Digital divides, selection bias, the Matthew effect, corporate capture, and the agency divide appear as "risks" at the end of sections rather than as structuring constraints on the proposed models.

### 5. Weak integration between parts
University, enterprise, and recruiting sections sit side-by-side. There are no explicit feedback loops showing how employer behaviour reshapes curricula, how corporate learning compensates for university failures, or how policy connects them.

### 6. Evidence quality not distinguished
Vendor case studies, small pilots, and meta-analyses are cited at the same authority level. Strong quantitative claims ("categorically superior") lack context/sample caveats. The CBE evidence paradox (meta-review vs WGU/SNHU success) is unresolved.

### 7. Public mission underweighted
Research, democratic citizenship, cultural memory, and liberal arts are treated as risks (mission drift) rather than as affirmative design anchors. No positive model of AI-era public universities is offered.

### 8. Descriptive/normative/speculative blurred
Trends, recommendations, and speculation appear in the same paragraphs without signposting. Readers cannot tell what is happening, what should happen, and what might happen.

### 9. Not structured for general audience
Chapter titles are academic, the innovation and pitfalls chapters are exhaustive rather than selective, and the three recruiting chapters overlap significantly.

## Proposed V2 Structure

| V2 Ch | Title | Source Material (V1) | Key Change |
|-------|-------|---------------------|------------|
| 01 | What Exactly Is Broken? | ch01 intro, ch04, ch02 | Define "broken" precisely; scope statement |
| 02 | The Rise of the Intelligence Factory | ch01, ch03 | Add replace/complement/layer framework + table |
| 03 | How Systems Actually Change | new + ch04 governance bits | Actor-incentive mapping; adoption reality checks |
| 04 | New Models of Learning | ch05, ch06 (merged) | 5 archetypes with consistent pattern; pitfalls inline |
| 05 | Degrees, Skills, and the Signalling Stack | ch01, ch03, ch05, ch11, ch13 | Layered signal model; time horizons |
| 06 | The Stratification Trap | ch06 equity bits, ch01 agency divide | Equity as central design constraint |
| 07 | Learning in Companies | ch20, ch21 | Bridge to Part I; simplified for general audience |
| 08 | AI in Hiring | ch11, ch12, ch13 | Single chapter; feedback loops to universities |
| 09 | Universities as Public Institutions | ch01 crucible, ch05 governance | Positive public-mission model |
| 10 | Three Futures for Education | new | 3 scenarios with personas; choice framing |

### Cross-cutting tasks
- **Evidence hierarchy**: Methodological note; caveats on vendor data; reconcile CBE paradox.
- **Claim-type signposting**: Mark descriptive (D), normative (N), speculative (S) throughout.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Notes

### Ch01 — What Exactly Is Broken?
- Pull the strongest problem statements from ch04 (financial pressures, enrollment decline, skills gaps, equity/wellbeing).
- Add stakeholder framing from ch02.
- Define 4 dimensions of "broken" and specify which parts of the education system the book addresses.
- End with a 1-paragraph roadmap.

### Ch02 — The Rise of the Intelligence Factory
- Core metaphor from ch01 and ch03.
- New subsection: what AI replaces (content delivery, routine assessment), complements (tutoring, analytics), cannot touch (research, socialization, character, public mission).
- Simple comparison table for lay readers.

### Ch03 — How Systems Actually Change
- Entirely new chapter filling the biggest structural gap.
- Map: who decides (governments, accreditors, faculty, employers, EdTech, students), what blocks change (funding formulas, unions, accreditation, culture), why adoption is uneven.
- Include 1-2 concrete examples of why micro-credentials spread faster in some countries.
- End with scenario matrix (regulatory openness vs institutional capacity).

### Ch04 — New Models of Learning
- Restructure ch05's exhaustive inventory into 5 archetypes.
- Each archetype follows a consistent template: what it is (1 para), why promising (bullets), evidence (labelled by quality), what can go wrong (from ch06).
- Eliminates the need for a separate pitfalls chapter.

### Ch05 — Degrees, Skills, and the Signalling Stack
- Resolves the tension the critics flagged.
- Acknowledges degrees are not dead yet; distinguishes sectors where portfolios dominate vs hard-gate professions.
- Introduces the 4-layer stack: degree baseline → micro-credentials → portfolio evidence → AI-derived behaviour signals.
- Short/medium/long-term timeline.

### Ch06 — The Stratification Trap
- Moves equity from periphery to centre.
- Synthesizes: agency divide (ch01), Matthew effect in alliances (ch06), corporate capture (ch06), selection bias in peer models (ch06), digital divides (ch04).
- "Who wins / who loses?" boxes per model.
- Proposes non-negotiable corrective design features per archetype.

### Ch07 — Learning in Companies
- Merge ch20 (overview) with ch21 (deep report), cutting ~50% of ch21's length.
- Bridging intro: which university failures corporate learning compensates for, which it shouldn't try to replace.
- Reader-facing messages: expect learning as part of your job; don't expect companies to substitute foundational education.

### Ch08 — AI in Hiring
- Merge 3 recruiting chapters into 1, eliminating significant overlap (AI adoption stats, skills-based hiring, EU AI Act context appear in all three).
- Focus on what matters to individuals: how AI screens you, what skills-based hiring means in practice, new assessments.
- End with feedback loop section: employer behaviour → curriculum design → policy → corporate learning.

### Ch09 — Universities as Public Institutions
- Answers the critics' concern that the humanistic agenda is only a footnote.
- Positive model: research, democratic citizenship, cultural memory as design anchors.
- Funding models compatible with modularity.
- Concrete practices for character formation (not just metaphors).

### Ch10 — Three Futures for Education
- Replaces scattered scenario hints with 3 vivid futures.
- Each future shown through 2 personas (18-year-old student, 40-year-old worker).
- Policy and institutional choices that push toward each.
- Frames as choice, not technological destiny.

## Material Disposition

### V1 files → V2 mapping

| V1 File | Disposition |
|---------|------------|
| `_readme` | Replace with v2 TOC |
| `01-farewell-to-traditional-universities` | Split across v2 ch01, ch02, ch05, ch06 |
| `02-stakeholders` | Absorbed into v2 ch01 |
| `03-parts-and-institutions` | Absorbed into v2 ch02 |
| `04-major-challenges` | Primary source for v2 ch01; governance bits to v2 ch03 |
| `05-innovative-approaches` | Restructured as v2 ch04 |
| `06-pitfalls-and-traps` | Distributed inline across v2 ch04, ch06 |
| `11-recruiting-trends` | Merged into v2 ch08 |
| `12-recruiting-challenges` | Merged into v2 ch08 |
| `13-recruiting-innovations` | Merged into v2 ch08 |
| `20-enterprise-trends` | Merged into v2 ch07 |
| `21-employee-qualification` | Merged into v2 ch07 (condensed) |

### Net result
- **V1**: 11 chapters + readme, 3 loosely connected parts, ~4,300 lines
- **V2**: 10 chapters, tight narrative arc (problem → forces → models → signals → equity → enterprise → hiring → public mission → futures), estimated ~3,000-3,500 lines after deduplication

## Priority Order

1. **Ch01 + Ch02** — establish the thesis and central metaphor first
2. **Ch03** — fill the biggest structural gap (change models)
3. **Ch04 + Ch06** — innovations and equity as paired chapters
4. **Ch05** — signalling stack resolves a key tension
5. **Ch07 + Ch08** — enterprise and recruiting consolidation
6. **Ch09 + Ch10** — public mission and futures
7. **Cross-cutting** — evidence hierarchy and claim-type signposting (final pass)
